The dark altar~
Within the centre of this small room stands a tall statue of KaVir, founder
of the DarkBlades.  The black writhing form of the statue moves in a gruesome
parody of life that you find unsettling, and the aura of pure evil forces you
to your knees under the gleaming eyes of the Demon Lord.
Strapped in front of the Altar is a struggling victim of the DarkBlades.
Although he has been impaled on the altar, evil magics have been used to keep
him alive, and his blood continually pumps from his body, pouring through a
small hole in the base of the altar.

the pit below you a gust of icy cold wind almost blows you from your feet.

over you with an almost tangable presence.

forces you back a step.

souls of those foolish enough to cross the DarkBlades...
You desperately try to leave, but the swirling souls of the damned drag you
back down into the pit, forcing you to the ground.  You cover your ears in an
attempt to keep out their screams of eternal agony, and futilely attempt again

trapped, and it can only be so long before the master of the pit returns to
claim his prize...your soul.
