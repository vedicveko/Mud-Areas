*Castle of the Vampyre
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova



Part of the Dark and Sinister Forest, also available for download, this is
a castle molded into a cliff-face with an underarea full of vampyres. The
upper level holds a smattering of Gypsy caretakers and some rats and bats.

Some decent eq available as well as some good exp for the high level player.
