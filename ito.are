#HELPS
Shrouded in mystery, the Ito Stronghold is a haven for assassins and
evil doers. It's highest ranking members inhabit a Pagoda guarded by a
tremendous dragon. Any who go there should be very careful. If you do go,
liking to uninvited guests. Lord Genjiro has been known to slay
adventurers and guests just for entering the gates of the Ito Stronghold.

Ito Stronghold was written by Vaevictis for Devil's Silence MUD
(ds.ruinsmud.com:5000).  It is being used with the understanding
that the area will remain relatively intact and that the help file shall
not change, only changes to hp/weapon dice/armor class and the like are
allowed.  Names and descriptions will not change.

You come to the foothills of the Ito Mountains.  A forest surrounds you
as the path continues through the hills to the mountains looming beyond

At the corner of the Main street and RoHai Lane.~
You stand at the corner of the Main street and RoHai lane, this appears
to be the residential section of the city.  Many houses line this portion of
the road and torches appear at regular intervals, providing the citizens
with light.

dim as the night wears on.

At the corner of the back road and RoHai Lane.~
At the corner here, you see a sign on the north building that says
'Fontu's Jewelry'.  To the west is a dark building.  Light from the torches
paints your weapon a blood red.  Shouting from the main street can be heard,
and it sounds like it is closing on your position.

At the corner of the Main Street and a side alley.~
This corner looks as if no poverty exists in the city at all.  Elaborate
houses line the street and finely wrought gates protect them from outsiders.

The corner of the back road and a side alley.~
This portion of the city seems to be a lower class section.  Not the
slums, but not the richest part either.  Shabby looking houses line the
streets, light seeping through the greasy windows.  The gutters of this
street stink as raw sewage is backed up in them, it appears that the
sanitation crews in this city don't make it over here that often.  A lone
dog is barking in the distance, and shouts can be heard from the south back
toward the main street.

own more now than they will ever own in their whole life.  Trash lines the
gutters, and spills over onto the street, some people search through it
hungrily, looking for food.

Around the bend.~
You have come upon a small bend in the path.  The trees and darkness seem
to close around you and animals of the forest quiet themselves and take
flight at your approach.  Exits are east and west.

Continuing down the path to the Stronghold.~
As you round the bend to continue upon thepath, you notice a forbidding
gate to the north.  From this distance it seems that you can barely make out
moving spots of torchlight.  Preparing yourself for a confrontaion that may
never happen, you press onward.
