A rough stone path~
You are on a rough stone path on the north cliff face.  Your passage East and
West is blocked, but you may still move Up and Down.  There is nothing to the
south.

Thieves guild~
The thieves guild is pretty small, as most thieves have left the city for
bigger and better booties, but the recent prosperity of the shopkeepers has
caused operations to begin expanding again.
You see a thin leather book tied to a string on the wall.

book~
The book is titled 'So You Want to be a Thief', by someone named Slash.

   The book has the following chapters you can LOOK at.  (Don't even think of
nicking this book.)

   Chapter 1:  So you have decided to become a thief  (LOOK NEWBIE)
   Chapter 2:  Stealing, Nicking and Borrowing        (LOOK STEAL)
   Chapter 3:  The Art of surprise                    (LOOK BACKSTAB)
   Chapter 4:  Sneaking around where you don't belong (LOOK SNEAK)

   It looks like someone nicked the rest of the book...
~
E
newbie~
Ok, you have made it to the thieves guild.  I will assume that you know how
to do things like PRACtice and talk to the other players, and know to run away
from a fight you can't win.

   The guildmaster here is very good at teaching you the tools of the trade.
However, he is a lot more interested in staying in this room and picking that
big lock than he is in helping you.  He is not going to tell you what to
study or give you hints on how to rob.  If you are having trouble figuring out
what skills to PRACtice, use the CANT command to speak to the other thieves on
line.  They will help you.  (This book also has a few pointers.)
~
E
steal~
Steal lets you take things from players and mobs without having to fight
them for it.  You won't get any experience points for using this or any other
thieving skill, but you can get money and objects pretty quick.
   To steal money, use STEAL <number> <character>.  To steal an object, use
STEAL <object> <character>.  The object must be in the character's inventory,
not worn.  You want to know what the character has in the inventory to steal,
so you will need to PRACtice PEEK, too.
   I have staked a kobold to the ground.  He has a ROCK in his inventory.  Try
to steal it from him.  When you have gotten the rock, please give the rock
back to the kobold so the other thieves can steal it from him.  Notice that you
can't steal the collar off of him.
~
E
backstab~
Backstab lets you sneak up behind a mob (but not a player) and hit the
really hard in the back with a dagger.  This does a lot of extra damage, and
you should have a much easier time finishing him off.  You need to use a small
dagger-type weapon to do this, a big slashing sword doesn't have the right kind
of point.
   If you are grouped with some warriors, they will tell you that you have to
backstab the mob.  If you do this, the mob will attack only you and they will
take no damage.  You should make them use their skills and RESCUE you.
   Don't use this skill until you are at least GOOD at it.  Otherwise you will
be wasting your first attack with a pitiful backstab attempt...
~
E
sneak~
Sneak and hide are used on players, not mobs.  DO NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO
WALK INTO AN AGGRESSIVE AREA stealthily.  Use invisibility for this...

You are standing on a part of the cliff that is at about a 45% angle.  You
can stay here as long as you want.  You are glad sandstone is a very strong
and sturdy geological formation.
   There are too many clouds below to see if the buzzards circle below this
point.

Small level area on the cliff face~
You stand on a small level area on the cliff face.  Better stay here, it
looks like a single step in any direction would leave you heading down at a
rapid speed.  The good news is that the cliff is so steep here you would
probably survive your fall all the way to the bottom far below...

as the last guy who stopped here, and he left claw marks for at least 50' down
the side of the crag.  You wave at his bones below and commend his good taste.

structures do not have the natural permanence of the well built buildings or

IT IS WAY TO STEEP TO KEEP GOING DOWN!  YOU WOULD DIE!
(Even if you are able to fly, there is nothing interesting down from here.
This canyon is actually a huge chasm that goes deep into the earth, there is
lots of boiling hot lava and stuff down there that would burn your flesh.  I
could write 500 rooms of 'it's getting a little hotter' before I describe your
firey demise, but you really aren't worth the trouble.)

Inside the stronghold~
The inside of this cave has been straightened into a passable corridor.
The Aarakocran high command uses this cave to handle defense of the valley as
the south face of the valley is not reachable except from the air.
   Judging from the high quality of the furniture around you, you should be
able to find some very valuable shiny stuff.  Your heart races as you imagine
yourself living in such splendor one day.
