Dearest Sister,
Please let us put aside all our differences, and strive to reconcile this rift that
has come between us.  I am willing to forgive you your treasonous behaviour
with Accolon, but I must demand that you remove your son from my halls
and bid him accept that he can never be king of these lands.  I also must
insist that you return back to me Excalibur, which is my sword, by divine
right.

Lake~
You emerge from Camelot to find yourself at the edge of a lake.  The mist
makes it hard to see where you are going, and you stumble on the uneven
ground.  A glowing sign rises up before you, beckoning you closer to read
closer to read the words inscribed on it.  There are faint lights shining in
the mist from the south and the east.

Lake Shrine~
This is a lake shrine to some small, unnamed deity.  There is a small
standing stone with a rude altar in front of it.  The altar is scattered
with various offerings; bread and flowers are strewn about the stones and
altar.  The cold mist from the lake drifts over you, chilling you to the
bone.

Lake  House~
You enter the cool, dark halls of the Lake House.  The floors are of a
cold grey stone, and a freezing breeze blows across your feet.  You can hear
the murmur of voices from within, and the occasional rustle of a robe. 
The gatekeeper's room lies to the north, and Niniane's room is to the south.

Morgause's Room~
This room is filled with fine clothing and mirrors.  It is obvious that
the inhabitant of the room is more concerned with her looks and possessions
than in learning wisdom from the priestesses.  Morgause herself is sitting
in front of a mirror, brushing her long, red hair and plotting against her
cousin, Arthur.

Niniane's room is filled with rocks and coral, and other objects the lady
in question has collected over the years.  Most prominient are several large
pieces of quartz crystal displayed on the bedside table.  The room is filled
with heavy wooden furniture, all carved with ivy and tendrils of roses.

Gatekeeper's Room~
The private room of the gatekeeper of Avalon is an austere place, with
only a hard bunk, chest, and small table gracing the room.  The walls are of
a dark grey stone, and a small brazier rests on the table, barely warming
the chill in the air.  The gatekeeper herself sits by the table, spinning
only a hard bunk, chest, and small table gracing the room.  The walls are of
wool.

Lake House~
You continue along the hallway that runs through the lake house. 
Acolytes and priestesses pass by you on their way to their errands, and
there is a a faint murmur to be heard throughout the house.  The rustle of
robes blends in with the faint murmuring and creates a very peaceful
atmosphere.  Rooms lie to the north and south, and the hallway continues
east and west.

Nimue's Room~
Nimue's room is draped in black, and the faint tang of sorrow hangs heavy
in the air.  Everywhere you look, there are reminders to the lady of her
betrayal of the Merlin of Britain.  Kevin's harp rests on the bedside table,
and his staff leans against the wall.  The lady herself lies on her bed,
weeping quietly for the false Merlin.

west and south.  Women hurry by, and the occasional pictish warrior.  The
sounds of chanting come from the south, and the faint sounds from the lake
are almost lost to you here.

Morgaine's Room~
You have entered the rooms of Morgaine, who will be high priestess of
Avalon after Viviane rejoins the great wheel.  The room is a barren place,
hosting only a table, chair, and bedstand.  There is a black robe laying
across the bed, and a sheaf of drying herbs rests on the table.  A sickle
knife rests beside the sheaf.  Morgaine sits at the table, preparing some
herbal concoction.

This wing of the Lake House is very quiet, with only the occasional
acolyte wandering by.  The murmuring you heard is now faint, and the sounds
from the rooms are muffled.  Your footsteps sound loud against the cold
stone floor, and you can hear echoes reflecting back off the walls towards
you.

and the sounds of prayer come from the west, where Igraine's room lies.

You have entered the rooms of the high priestess of Avalon.  The room is
barren, except for a bed and bedside table.  Apparently all the work of the
house is done elsewhere.  A chart of the moon phases hangs on the wall and a
silver crescent lies on the bed.  Viviane stands looking out the window. 
She doesn't seem to notice your presence.

You have entered Igraine's room.  The room is decorated with crosses and
pictures of events important to christianity.  It is indeed an odd sight to
greet your eyes, as Igraine is a daughter of the Holy Isle of Avalon.  A
large bed sits in the center of the room, and a bedside table beside it
holds a cup of wine.  Lady Igraine kneels at a prie-dieu underneath a large
copper cross hanging on the far wall.

chanting to the east, but to the west is silence.

flowers and herbs and other plants.  You see careful embroidery beneath each
plant detailing it's medicinal uses, and conclude that these must be tools
used in the training of priestesses.
