"Our country reeks of trees,
 our yaks are really large,
 and they smell like rotting beef carcasses,
 and we have to clean up after them,
 and our saddle sores are the best,
 we proudly wear women's clothing,
 and searing sand blows up our skirts.

 And the buzzards they soar overhead,
 and poisonous snakes will devour us whole.
 Our bones will bleach in the sun...
 And we will probably go to hell,
 and that is our great reward,
 for being thuh-uh Roooy-al
 Canadian Kilted Yaksmen."

A Strange Forest Path~
This is a strange forest indeed.  Even though it is broad daylight, the
light filtering through the trees is dim.  In the distance you hear faint
chanting noises, almost as if the forest were full of Hare Krishnas.  Or
something.  A sign is nailed to a tree.

strange mutations and fish in the trees around you.  You are grateful you
are not naked under their accusing gaze.  You feel like some kind of
freak.
