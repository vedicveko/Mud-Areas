The very secret room.~
You are standing in the very secret room.On the wall you can see some pictures. There is a sofa you can sit on to watch the fireplace in front of you. Logs are in it but they don't seem to want to burn out.
Some pillows are on the floor.
The room is just warm, and you feel that it is the same all year long. A nice place to rest your old bones.
