Entrance to Pepperland~
You are walking along a well-used road that leads towards a fabulously
colourful and noisy conglomeration of shops, houses and roads that is
collectively known as Pepperland. Populated by a bizarre array of
people and fantastic creatures that defy the imagination, Pepperland
is an area guaranteed to thrill you all. So feel free to walk on in
and take a look around- but BE CAREFUL! Not all in Pepperland is
benign...
Oh, you also see a small sign.
Oh and there is ANOTHER sign, a plaque mounted on a rock.

plaque~
The plaque reads-
"Welcome to Pepperland, Yaegar and Aurorix's contribution to AM. 
Pepperland is suitable for just about any level of character. We
hope you have a good time, but must issue a small caveat- there are
some VERY tough mobs in Pepperland, and some aggs too, so be sure to
use con and scan an awful lot.
Oh, BTW, if you die here, don't ask Yaegar for a CR. He warned you,
and that will only prove that you didn't listen. :P"

The Magical Mystery Tour Stops Here~
As you enter Pepperland, the first thing you see is a huge yellow
bus full of people sitting by the side of the road. Evidently it
has broken down. The passengers are starting to become agitated,
some of them having disembarked, and a pretty tour guide is attempting
to quieten them by starting a cheery singalong. You feel like joining in.

The Barbershop~
You are strolling by a barbershop in Penny Lane, outside of
which congregate several people who appear to be examining
something held by the barber. You may take a peek if you wish,
but the barber sometimes goes away to shave another customer, and
may not be here. It will be impossible for you to get inside for
a shave- the barber has many clients and it would take months to
obtain an appointment.

The Middle of the Roundabout~
You are standing in the middle of the roundabout that demarcates

has been erected here, and thus this roundabout is frequently
occupied by various people seeking transport to their homes.
Several plants that look SUSPICIOUSLY like opium poppies grow
wild here.

A Quiet Section of the Club~
This area of the club manages to escape much of the noise and smoke

room, where hopeful young musicians wait for a chance to audition
with the Sergeant in the practice room to the north. Unfortunately, his 
standards are very high, and most leave here disappointed, their hopes
and dreams smashed by a savage twist of musical fate.

there is still a palpable air of sadness and loneliness about the
place of worship. There is a graveyard to the east.

Mackenzie is usually here- he strives to protect the rest of the dead

the hoe-down, a rough-and-tumble gin-joint. In the distance to the

Or, you can head towards the sound of piano music to the east, or a

Further Inside the Submarine~
You have reached a junction, where open hatchways allow access to a
stateroom to the north, or a pleasant-looking bar to the south. The
walls are just as sickeningly bright here as they are near the
entrance, and you wonder how the residents put up with it...You
feel like you're in a cartoon.

You have entered a nicely-decorated cocktail bar, with velvet wall
coverings hiding the obnoxious yellow paintwork. "You Know My Name"
is playing on loudspeakers somewhere, and a very odd-looking bartender
introduces himself as Dennis O'Dell. You are starting to get that
strange not-all-here-is-real feeling again...

Some Pot-holes in the Road~
You have entered Blackburn, Lancashire, which must have at least
4,000 pot-holes, or one twenty-sixth of a hole per person. You are also
near the home of John Lennon, who resides with the mysterious Flattop
and the Ono creature. Alternatively, you could leave, and return to Abbey 
Road. There is also an interesting school to the north, and a sinister-
looking area to the south.

You are walking down Abbey Road. Up ahead, you see a zebra crossing,
and a white Volkswagen with a yellow licence-plate that reads "LMW
28IF", which obviously shows beyond any doubt that Paul McCartney is
dead. Any fool could see that. This road leads towards the man in
question's house, as well as the house of John Lennon.

"The Quarreymen Rule!" on one of the walls.
