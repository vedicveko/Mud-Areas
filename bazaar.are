Entrance to the Bazaar~
You are walking toward the Bazaar, a huge marketplace full of brightly-
colored tents, within which dozens of merchants hawk their wares to the
public. The market is always crowded, and you quickly break out in a sweat
as you elbow your way through the teeming hordes of people.

market square to the north. Merchants, traders, slaves, vagrants and thieves
all rush by you, and you find yourself feeling quite dizzy.

a small counter covered with scraps of expensive material. A small tailor
is busy making alterations to the robes of some nobleman, and he tells you
around a mouthful of pins that he won't be long.

At this point in the central area, a dais has been erected, and atop it stands
a burly man selling some of his trained warrior slaves. If you wish you can
stop and examine his merchandise, or proceed north into the center of the
market square, or east or west along Buyer's Lane, which dissects the square
at this point.

rush to and fro on business of their own, as merchants flog their wares to
them mercilessly. Slaves, whores, beggars and thieves mingle with the crowd,
each of them attempting to elicit a few coppers from any generous souls by
one means or another.

As you enter, you are almost overwhelmed by the overpowering aroma of hundreds
of exotic spices, and you are not surprised to see that the proprietor is
wearing nose plugs. This makes more sense still when he explains to you that
many of his herbs have magical or addictive qualities, either or both of
which can take effect with but a single sniff...

keep a small stock of genuine jewellery for customers who don't wish to

The Wall of the Bazaar~
You are heading along the northern part of Buyer's Lane, past the market to
the south, and the houses and shops built into the wall to the north. People
enter and exit many of these houses as you watch, and you surmise that no
place in the bazaar is free of mercantilism- everyone has something to sell.

A Brothel~
Several merchants look away with embarrassment as you catch their eyes upon
entering. Evidently visiting such places is not considered good for business,
if you are caught. Several attractive men and women smile seductively at
you, and you gulp nervously. Have you had your shots?

A Guard House~
This room serves as quarters for the market guards. There are rarely many
guards in here at any one time- the market is so busy and so prone to
crime that they rarely have time to relax.

Near the Docks~
You are standing near the docks of the city, which lie upon the massive
harbour it is nestled in. Ships of all nations sail back and forth, either
delivering or picking up cargo, passengers or illicit goods. Near here there
is a large warehouse, wherein ships are constructed for anyone with the
interest and the financial means.

A Shipyard~
Here you may negotiate the purchase of a seagoing vessel to suit your needs.
There is no shortage of supply in a huge port such as this; indeed, in this
city, ships are more common than horses.

The Market Square~
This is the center of the bazaar, and the primary gathering point for the
hordes of people who visit the bazaar every day and night. You see strangely-
clad visitors from many foreign lands clamoring to buy and sell every
conceivable item known to humanity. The air is thick with the stench of stale
sweat, camel manure and exotic spices.

At this point Buyer's Lane cuts through the square, running east-west.
