Entrance to The Body Parts Castle~
Welcome to Body Parts!  You have entered a really strange place.  The air
is thick and there is a rotten smell here.  An old man sits in a corner
talking nonsense.  He tells you that the ruler of his fair land has been
blown to pieces and his bodyparts have come alive to revenge his death. 
They have taken control of everything and they have shaped the castle as a
human body.  He begs you to help destroy the brain of the "body"....  Before
it takes over the whole world and makes us all slaves.  To the east and west
you see rooms shaped as feet...  Strange!
