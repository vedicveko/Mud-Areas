#HELPS
Trillium was once famous for the armor and weapon's that it made, but now
it's a forgotten city, mostly spoken of in children's stories.  The city
above was destroyed in a battle long long ago, and the citizens migrated
to the caverns underneath the city, where they have lived ever since.

Trillium Caverns was written by Alecca for Devil's Silence MUD
(ds.ruinsmud.com:5000).  It is being used with the understanding
that the area will remain relatively intact, only changes to hp/weapon
dice/armor class and the like are allowed.  Names and descriptions will
not change.

The entrace to the fabled Trillium Caverns is here.  The land of Trillium 
used to extend beyond Midgaard, past New Thalos, but now it has been reduced 
to just the caverns.  It is still a monarchy, albeit a lesser one, compared 
to the Trillium of the past.
