You have reached the end of the rainbow.  But alas, there is not pot of
gold.  Where could it be?  All you see to the north is an old, ruined
tower...  You also hear a loud wailing coming from that direction.  To the
south, you can follow the rainbow to its other end.

Ruins of An Ancient Tower~
You step through the rubble into a large, flat open space.  Tiny piles of
rubble are all over.  Weeds are growing up out of an eroding stone floor. 
Then, you see it.  In one corner of the room is a large black kettle. 
Something inside it is glowing!

treasure~
You find a bit of sentimentally valuable treasure here.  You also notice
a note scrawled amongst the relics.  "I see a fire," it reads.  The fire
lies within each and every one of us.  We all have to sleep, and the fire is
in our dreams.  You must seek the location of the fire near a person's
dream, and look at the pictures it reveals unto you.
