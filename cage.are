Entrance to Cage and Aquarium~
You fall into a brightly lit yet very surreal looking field. The sun is
shining, the birds are singing, and you are suddenly overtaken by an
overwhelming feeling of love. Unfortunately, at the same time you're starting
to get a nagging feeling that something is also terribly amiss. Looking up, you
watch the opening that you entered through from above close up and disappear.
As you look around, you notice a small welcoming sign. Beyond the sign there
is a path leading down to a road.

Somewhere on Toddler Hiway~
You stand on a road named Toddler Hiway. The road looks as though it runs in a
straight line to the east and west. There is a small path on a hill leading up
and perhaps back out of this crazy place. To the south you see an old and
beaten up camping trailer. There is a lot of screaming going on in there, so
maybe now is not such a good time to knock on the door.

Upon closer inspection, you see that the note reads:

             "WHEN IT RAINS, IT SNOWS".                                

Wonder what that could mean?~

The trailer is very very long and very very beaten up. There are a number of
stickers pasted all over the side, and also there is some strange graffiti
painted underneath the window.~

One of the stickers is the emblem of the state of West Virginia. Where the

A Kitchen in the Long Long Trailer~
You enter the kitchen in the long long trailer. What a mess!  There are broken

Christmas already?  Where does the time go?

The Ocean~
The spray from the water hits you in the face, and the salty water stings your
eyes and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's a good thing that you have an
ample supply of fresh water with you. You DO have an ample supply of fresh
water, don't you? To the west you see some dark high cliffs and unforgiving
sharp rocks.

You continue walking along a dusty road. Your throat gets dry as you breathe
in the dirty air. The smell of camel dung assails your nostrils.

Istanbul~
You stand before a beautiful fountain. The mist from the spraying water is
nearly dry the moment it touches your skin. It feels good. It feels so good in
fact, that you try to remember the last time that you bathed. As you swallow a
gulp of lukewarm water and feel quench your yearning throat, you notice all
the dirty townspeople bathing in the fountain water. The urge to heave
overwhelms you.
You puke in the fountain.
