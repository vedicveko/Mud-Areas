*Jareth
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


Jareth was my very first zone, which I stupidly used zone #30 as my vnum
base.  I figured that overwriting would be easier and I could use the
existing info for reference as I was writing offline at the time and was
pretty confused as to how the files were set up.  I was wrong about it
being easier and I don't suggest that route for anyone new to building ;-)

Jareth has all the amenities of a hometown with a couple of added features.
There is the Casino off the Boardwalk - look for the snippet if you need it
on the snippet page - where players can try their luck and see if they can
make some money the old fashioned way.  There is a blood bank near the
Temple where a player can give blood, losing some hp, but gaining some cash.
The cash is minimal and the hp drain is too, but for a newbie, anything helps.

This was to be our main town for all of Dibrova, however with a bit of
whining and a lot of persuasion, we went the route of allowing players to
choose their hometown at the main menu and unfortunately most do not choose
this wondrous metropolis.

Please forgive if any objs or mobs are close to Midgaard's - in my defense
I say that is WAS my first zone, and I was very in the dark on how a mud
worked at all at the time. ;-)
