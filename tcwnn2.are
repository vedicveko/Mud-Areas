While Elves are not by nature particularly interested in war or soldiering,
there are, as in all races, "black sheep" who feel the call to arms as
keenly as any Dwarven or Human mercenary. These few become mercenaries or
adventurers. Some of them, such as this fellow, labor for the forces of
good, if the price is right.

Inside the Guard Tower~
You are standing inside the northern guard tower at the west gate. This
tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture has been arranged about the room for off-
duty guards. A spiral staircase winds its way up to the next floor in one
corner. A fire burns merrily away in a hearth to the east, the smoke
escaping through a small shaft that runs up one side of the turret.

Inside the Guard Tower~
You are standing inside the southern guard tower at the west gate. This
tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture has been arranged about the room for off-
duty guards. A set of dominos and a small pile of silver pieces suggest that
a friendly game between some guards was recently in progress. It seems the
guards were called away in a hurry, for they left their winnings behind. A
spiral staircase winds its way up to the next floor in one corner.

Inside the Western City Wall~
You are making you way along a narrow corridor that runs through the
center of the cyclopean walls of the city of Anon. Crossbow slits at regular
intervals allow you to look out upon the western plains that lie beyond
the city. Crossbowmen walk back and forth, talking and joking but ever alert
for any signs of attack. After a while you begin to feel slightly
claustrophobic.

A door leads south into the north tower, west gatehouse.

Northwest Tower~
This massive circular tower rises at the northwest corner of the city walls.
It is sixty feet tall, and thirty feet in diameter, making it just about the
largest tower you've ever seen. Guards march back and forth past you,
barely sparing you a second glance as they busily go about their duty. Doors
to the east and south allow you to enter the passages that run through the
bowels of the walls, and a staircase allows you to proceed up or down
through the tower.

You are standing inside the northern guard tower at the east gate. This
tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture, deeply scored with dagger cuts, has been
arranged about the room for off-duty guards. Several pewter mugs half-full
of the local brew sit about near a game of draughts. A spiral staircase winds
its way up to the next floor in one corner. A fire burns merrily away in a
hearth to the east, the smoke escaping through a small shaft that runs up one
side of the turret.

The writing says-

"Now my charms are all o'erthrown, and what strength I have's mine own;
 which is most faint; now, 'tis true, I must be here confined by you, or
 send to Naples. Let me not, since I have my dukedom got and pardon'd the
 deceiver dwell in this bare siland by your spell; but release me from my
 bands with the help fo your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please. Now I want spirits
 to enforce, art to enchant; and my ending is despair, unless I be reliev'd
 by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all
 faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me
 free". (The Tempest, Epilogue)

The Gatehouse~
You are standing in the gatehouse that houses the great western mithril
valves of the City of Anon. Massive guard towers lie to the north and south.
There are murder holes set in the floor at your feet, allowing defenders
to pour boiling oil upon any who manage to breach the gate. The western wall
is crossletted for archers, and through it you can see the plains of
western Anon, and beyond them an impenetrable mountain range.

Southwest Tower~
This room serves as quarters to the Knights of the Grand and Holy Order of
Anon assigned to wall guard duty. This room resembles a chapel more than
anything, with two small cots arranged near an altar bearing a chalice and
a ewer. A tapestry hangs on one wall, depicting knights receiving blessings
from Lenny.

Southeast Tower~
This room serves as the quarters of the commanders of the south and east
wall guards. It is sparsely decorated, featuring only two beds, two wardrobes,
a mirror and two footlockers. A few weapons are neatly arranged on one wall,
and a throw rug lies near the staircase.

A Dusty Chamber~
This room has an evil feel to it. The smashed furniture, bloodstains and
broken bones are bad enough, but in addition there is a definite evil aura
to this fell domain, as if some foul deed has been perpetrated here. You
get the distinct feeling that this place is haunted.

The Top of Northwest Tower~
This room is the quarters of the Guards Provost-Marshal, Glenwellucan Mad-
Llleweleucam. He is a rather senile old veteran of more wars than he could
possibly count. The room is littered with memorabilia, probably worth a
fortune to a collector, but useless to you. Then again, maybe not...

The Roof of Northwest Tower~
The Marshal uses this area as a relaxation area. There is a deckchair and
a small table, for use on sunny days- the Marshal sports a very healthy
tan. An umbrella lies folded up next to a bookcase with several tattered
magazines.

The Battlemages' Quarters~
Here reside the battlemages currently in the employ of the City. As they
spend little free time doing anything but meditating or learning new spells,
this room has little of interest. There is a bookcase full of scrolls, but
none of them are magical.

The Roof of Southwest Tower~
This roof is totally featureless. Peering through the crenelations, you
get a good view of southwestern Anon, though. Due south lies the cursed
forest wherein a Witches' Coven is supposed to exist, and beyond that lies
the fabled elemental canyon.

The Healing Chambers~
In this room, generous priests and priestesses of Lenny give up their time
to tend to the illnesses of the city guards. They will tend to others'
injuries as well, for a fee. Such is the way of Lenny.

The Roof of Southeast Tower~
This roof has been recently swept clean, and a stone altar erected to the
Gods. The sun is caught by a reflecting crystal so that it shines directly
onto the altar at all times during the day. The effect is quite splendid.
You feel totally at ease in this place.

The Roof of the Cursed Northeast Tower~
This roof has not bee visited in a long time. The trapdoor is covered in
silvery mystic runes, as is the stone around it. A chill wind blows here,
at all times, and birds have been known to die when flying too close. It
is truly a cursed place.
