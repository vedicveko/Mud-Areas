demi lich demi-lich~
The Demi-Lich~
The Demi-Lich leaps from his throne as you enter the room, his evil
eyes fixed dead upon you!
~
The Demi-Lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful undead creature known
to exist.  Greatly resembling a wight or mummy, and being gaunt and skeletal
in form. It is, nevertheless a being of forboding might. Its eye sockets are 
black and empty, save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve as eyes. 
An aura of cold and darkness radiates from it, which makes it an ominous and 
fearsome sight. Despite the wasted, rotten flesh it is garbed in the rich 
clothes of nobility.

Keftab, the Ancient One~
Keftab, the Ancient One stands here, calmly searching ceaslessly.
~
A writhing, quivering mass of horrific, unspeakable flesh-like material, this
ancient one stares coldly about through its many multifacted eyes, viscious, 
vile smelling liquid seeps through its flesh in many places, originating from 
the ghastly, crater like pores which pepper his body. Disgustingly, large 
portions of its flesh seem to bubble with an alien life of their own. 
The surface of its body, where not oozing, is covered with mottled, grey, 
mossy protrusions, like some strange malignant blemishes. It emits low, 
gutteral mewlings from its fange, quivering oriface.

pits of hell!

Strange, the courtyard is very quiet, nothing appears to
be around. Off to the west you notice a small structure. Closer
to the castle, you can now make out some sort of statues on each
side of the entrance.

Inside a Small Stone Building~
As you enter the room you see several weapons hung upon
the walls, just as you start to take some of the weaponry you
notice that is has long since rusted and is of no use to you.
At the far end of the room you notice a small table, a closer
look reveals the remains of what may have been a knight. The
corpse, resting in a chair just behind the table appears to be
grasping something. Moving closer to the corpse you notice a
sword held tightly in the clutch on the skeletal figure, looking
at the sword you realize it is unlike the rest of the decayed
weaponry.... The blade appears to be razor sharp, and the metal
untarnished.

but unfortunatly you can not find any and you begin to fall! After

seemingly bottomless pit into which you have fallen. Just as you
decide that there must be no end and that you will fall eternally,
you notice a bed of very large steel spikes fast approaching you,
Alas there is no escape. You cry out in agony as the spikes pierce

A Narrow Tunnel~
Shifting the wall has revealed a long, narrow tunnel
in which you now find yourself. The tunnel is freshly dug
and appears to extend quite a long way. No doors are visible
save for the wall you just shifted.

A Narrow Tunnel~
As you come around a small corner in the tunnel, you see
a faint light to the south. The southern part of the tunnel
is lit by a dim light of some kind at the far end of the
tunnel.

A Narrow Tunnel~
At this point of the tunnel, the walls get closer together
and the passage gets very narrow. As you near the southern end
of the tunnel, the light grows brighter. The only apparent exits
from the room are north and south.

A Small Portal~
As you come to the end of the tunnel, you notice the
light is coming from a somewhat small portal. The light coming
from the portal is so intense that it nearly blinds you.
