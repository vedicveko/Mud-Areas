umber hulk~
an umber hulk~
A massive, purple skinned beast with multiple eyes and huge tusks lurks here.
~
These powerfully built creatures are feared foes of any subterranean
dwellers, for their muscular arms and huge tusks are capable of rending
many creatures in seconds. To find them so boldly outside their natural
habitat is bad for two reasons; one, it means all regular methods of
monster control have collapsed, making this a perilous place indeed to
be. And secondly, umber hulks are usually found outside of their lairs
only as lackeys of more powerful evil creatures such as Illithids and
Beholders. And if either of those fell creatures is about you could be
in serious trouble indeed...

A purple skinned illithid clad in the robes of a mage stands here.
~
Three illithid mages assist the beholder mage xyrtog in his insidious
schemes. One of them is usually away, recruiting new slaves or similar,
while the other two work here on ways to increase the sphere of the
ensorcellment's influence. And they are in a state of excitement, as
they have finally succeeded.

a foe to be easily dismissed. However, his movements are jerky, and
sluggish, as if he were doing this against his will, and this lack

Silus~
A slender elf, the proprieter of this establishment, stares blankly at you.
~
Silus is the proprieter of what was once a happy and prosperous pub,
but now being here makes you depressed and uneasy. He and his patrons
just sit and stare into space, no expression gracing their faces. Even
slapping and shaking them provokes only the briefest response.

overcome and entrapped here, where the faithful of No'ol can scorn and
deride it. The force field bars only it from moving; all others may pass
freely. Her armor bears many dents, and her skin is burned badly in several

of Qu'gphtek M'gyhr. With his illithid allies, he intends to expand
the range of his ensorcellment, and achieve what chaos has failed to
do for centuries, and without even having to spill a drop of blood, though
that does not worry the evil tyrant.

in the muck, which leads down into a sewer. Evidently at some stage
someone must empty this rubbish into the sewers below. But who..?

The Village of Hochenyana~
As you cross the bridge and enter Hochenyana, you are immediately struck
by the lack of activity in the traditionally bustling village. Certainly
there are citizens about, walking slowly up and down the clean streets, but
there is a jerkiness about their movements, and a dazed expression in their
glazed eyes. Even the wildlife seems wistless and dull. Something is amiss 
here, by Anagar, and you determine to find out what!

Main Street~
You pass into Hochenyana, and arrive at Main Street, the quadrangle
of avenues off of which all of the principal businesses and residences
of the thriving community rest. Normally the street would be abuzz with
activity, but today you see only a few emaciated townsfolk, staggering in
a daze up and down the street. Turning to greet some of them, you are taken
aback when they utterly ignore you.

Main Street runs west here, past several shops and houses. The street
is clean, and free of any debris or even a cracked cobblestone. Everything
seems to be in order, except for the zombie like villagers of course. A
foul smell wafts in from the north, while to the south you can hear someone
singing.

The Butchery~
A nauseating smell, one of dead meat left to rot, assaults your nostrils
as you enter, almost (but not quite) distracting you from the horrid
spectacle of dozens of mutilated corpses littering the bloodstained floor
and shop counter. The walls drip with gore and blood; even the ceiling has
been splattered with the stuff. You feel fairly certain that this is not
a healthy place to be...

A General Store~
The shelves in this little shop are filled, but as you peer closer you
notice that the items that fill them are rubbish, odds and ends no one would
ever want to buy. Confused, you wonder who in hades would be able to prosper
with such a business? Odd business is afoot in Hochenyana, to be sure.

You have reached a corner of the rectangular street of Hochenyana, where
it heads east and south. Shops and houses line each direction, though there
is little evidence of activity in them. Several lie nearby, their doors open
or missing entirely...
 
A weatherbeaten sign hangs over a small business to the west, marking it as
an inn or tavern of some sort.

Animal Attack~
The furniture in this dwelling has been smashed to flinders, the blood
stained remains a testament to the strength and ferocity of whatever
slew the hapless townsfolk who once resided here. The smell of rotting
meat is strong here, as is the fecund odor of a wild animal. Little
of use seems to have survived the assault.

The interior of this town pub has been recently swept clean, and the

half eaten food or the like. The entire place is fresh and clear of any

sit at the tables, reacting to little. The proprieter stands behind the
bar, absently wiping the counter top repeatedly, heedless of what he is
doing.

Main Street~
Main street runs south here, past several neatly manicured gardens and
more spacious, comfortable dwellings, while to the north it bends 
eastward, heading towards the entrance to the town. You notice a dog,
sitting listlessly in the gutter, ignoring your attempts to provoke him
into playing with stick or ball. The air here is still, and the ambient
noise level is contributed to only by you or the noise of shuffling
villagers' feet.

Potrax's Potions~
This is a well appointed alchemist's shop; the shelves are overburdened
with all manner of elixirs, potions, flasks and philters. Essential oils
fill jars and containers near the counter, upon which a smoky oil lamp
casts a smoky luminescence. Heaven to mages, the aroma and surrounds tend
to make others feel rather claustrophobic and uncomfortable.

This comfortable little dwelling boasts several plush easy chairs, a
small table covered in trinkets, a cupboard stacked with all manner of
cups and saucers, and a hearth, which has been packed for a cheery blaze.
There is no sign of any occupants, however, nor does anyone come running
when you yell out. Shrugging, you settle down in one of the chairs to 
rest for a short while.

any of the cheerless folk; something terrible is indeed amiss...

Where once there was a fine smithy, a place of the purchasing and 
repairing of items of war, now there is only a cold forge, some rusted
tools and a couple of suits of shoddy armor. Bloodstains carpet the 
straw floor, and the walls bear deep gouges, as if a terrific battle

The poor beasts that were stabled here have not been fed in months, and
abandoned thusly they slowly died of starvation. A foul occurence, and

defeat of the Chaos Hordes at this point by the townsfolk, it has not

have perished in the struggle, making you wonder what sort of creatures now

Normally this broad tree-lined thoroughfare would be abuzz with activity;
the townsfolk rushing to and fro on various errands. But now nary a soul
stirs, and those that do seem to be in a deep trance, from which even harsh
words and strong blows cannot awaken them. The buildings to either side 
appear to be ones of importance, especially the residence of the Mayor to
the southwest of here. To the southeast, a large white tower rises from the
huddle of dwellings.

tower and the mayor's house, respectively. Few townsfolk can be seen here,
and there is no sign of any sort of guard near either residence. To the
south Heroes' Walk continues towards the Temple of Asteh, deity of this

The side road ends before a sturdy oak door that marks the entrance to
an imposing two storey brick structure, with stained glass windows and
a tiled roof. Expensive in construction, its design signifies the importance
of its resident, as well as marks him as a man of power and respect. It
shows no sign of deterioration like many of the other structures in this
place, but you do still feel very uneasy, as if something were seriously
amiss.

You pass through the doorway into a long narrow hallway, lined with

this fine town. A thick rug covers most of the floor, and a neat
doormat has been discreetly positioned near the entrance to allow visitors
to clean their boots and save the quality of the doubtlessly expensive
rug. The ceiling is supported by thick exposed beams of oak, from which
chandeliers depend, affixed to sturdy iron chains as thick as your forearm.

piles of official documents, but from here it looks as if most of them are
either blank or covered in meaningless scribbles. A plush chair rests behind
the desk, for the convenience of the Mayor's secretary, as does a large
lantern, which burns continuously, the result of a minor but strong dweomer.
A stout wooden door to the west leads into the Mayor's office.

the head of a massive stag hangs above the polished wooden desk that is

The first notion that strikes you as you enter the tower is that whoever
originally constructed it would not have intended it to be in the state it
is now. Smashed furniture and shredded books cover the grimy floor, and
piles of mangled tapestries have been built into large nests for a variety
of vermin. The stench is unbearable, and unmistakably goblin. Your hatred
for these savage brutes grows as you continue through the carnage. To the
east, a stone staircase continues to the next level, while to the south
a long corridor heads to other chambers.

Two long tables crammed with a variety of alchemical equipment line

overburdened with books to the north. Some of these books have been scattered
on the floor in disgust by the shaman, who was not intelligent enough to

A Cell~
This cell is small, simple and relatively clean. A huddled body in one corner
is all that remains of the unfortunate soul trapped in here and left to die
of starvation after the townsfolk fell under the sway of the evil spell. Now
their enraged spirits linger, however, thirsting for revenge!

Heroes' Walk~
The walk continues south towards the temple of Asteh, to the south,
past the great Library of Hochenyana, a famed mage's retreat in the
empire. You shudder to think what will have happened to this once great
center of learning in these times of neglect.

The Library of Hochenyana~
To the east looms the impressive marble building that houses the 
repository of knowledge that is the Library of Hochenyana, renowned
the world over as a fine example of achievement in the Arts. Scholars
from across the Empire used to travel here to study at this place, but
these days none come, for word of the strange goings-on has begun to
spread among the academic community.

Before the Temple of Asteh~
Rising to the south, like a great marble beast emerging from an ocean
of homes, is the impressive two tiered temple of Asteh, patron deity of
Hochenyana. Long wings of stone lead off of the main structure, which is
a large hemispherical marble building, supported by thick doric columns
spaced evenly about the perimeter. Elegant murals cover the walls within
these pillars, which protect the interior from the elements, though the
orginial architects protested, intending to have the central worship area
exposed, as a deity of the winds and air would wish. However, common sense
and the typically wet Estroglian weather prevailed.

The Antechamber~
Nary a whisper can be heard as you pass into the vaulted halls of
Asteh; it takes a while for you to realize that some sort of magical
enchantment is in place, cast here by the clerics of old to subdue 
boisterous worshippers as they entered. You must admit one soon loses
the desire to be noisy when one cannot hear the result! The walls are
bare here, starkly white with faint traces of silvery runes, which mark
two barely visible doors to the east and west. To the south lies the
central worship area, while the open entrance of the temple lies to the
north.

A Guard Room~
Even temples have need of security, in these times of trouble, and
the Temple of Asteh is not staffed by naive fools. Here they quarter a
stout guardian, whose purpose is to repel unwanted invaders. Unfortunately
he was easily overcome by the magical powers of the usurpers of Hochenyana,
and stuffed in here until they decide what to do with him.

The interior of this small room is dark, unnaturally so; even your
strong light cannot penetrate far into the gloom. You are able to make
out vague shapes of abandoned furniture and something small moving
furtively amongst them. The effect is eerie, and you unconsciously tighten

The passage opens onto the center of the hemispherical chamber, the
ceiling of which is elaborately decorated with murals depicting an open
sky, filled with birds and other creatures. A slight breeze blows continually
around the chamber, reminding you of a fresh spring morning. All of the pews
that normally rest on the blue stone floor here have been smashed to flinders,
however, and piled in the center of the room. Rats and maggots crawl about the
furniture, and the corpses of the clergy interred within.

which support a splendid marble plinth, the doors are nearly twenty feet

artisans entering a hall similar to this one, flanked by symbols of learning
and knowledge, such as the ruler, the compass, a thick book, quills and jars
of ink.

and musty, and smells strongly of old leather and crumbling parchment. Dog
eared manuscripts lie scattered all across the floor, tossed aside by someone
engaged in a frenetic search for a particular tome. The wealth of knowledge
concentrated here is beyond quanitifiable measure; you have no doubt that, if
you searched long and hard enough, you would find information on just about 
any subject under the sun.

vile demon No'ol and also suffices in a role as a sacrifical table. You
feel ill at ease here, and realize that the magical forces here will make
escape difficult from whatever may lie ahead, behind the massive bloodsoaked
altar. You dodge around mangled corpses dangling from barbed hooks attached
to long rusted metal chains depending from the arched ceiling, which has been
blackened by fire.

conducts operations here was spawned. To enter it would mean no return,
and you are certain that not even you could survive long when exposed to
the pure chaos that surely lurks at the bottom of this void. A shrill shrieking
emanates from all sides; its source hundreds of faces that press against the
walls, as if they belonged to people imprisoned within the shifting surface of
the stone. You had heard that all structures of Chaos were formed from the 
unwilling souls of sacrifical victims, bound to eternal excruciating pain as
building blocks for Chaos.

Presently you find the reason for the conspicuous absence of the goblins;
a massive pedestal rests here, upon which stands a guardian, placed here
by the mage some time ago to guard his most treasured possessions. It
has unfortunately been away from the guidance of its creator for too long,
however, and now berserkly attacks anything that enters here, which thus
far has only been many goblins, the corpses of which litter the floor.

his items. Perhaps, however, there are one or two lying around...
