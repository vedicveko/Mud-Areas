maschel duAngnain paladin undead slayer~
Maschel duAngnain~
An armored elf clad in the raiments of a paladin sworn to destroy undead stands here.
~
A tall, striking nobleman, Maschel duAngnain is a knight of both Malathar
and Maritshome, and is a sworn enemy of undead everywhere. He is currently
preparing to enter the Forest of the Dead once more, in another attempt to
lay low the evil that fester here, a sore blight on the Elven holdings.
If asked politely, he may be able to shed some light on some of the evil
forces that control the forest, and where they may be found.

Cresslix~
A diabolical creature of the undead cackles hideously.

Utterly evil, Cresslix the damned is a vile creature, in life a necromancer
of incredible power who has become an even greater threat in undeath. He
sits within his blackened tower of twisted metal, plotting the eventual
destruction of the Elven kingdom of Malathar, and many fear that he may well
one day succeed.

Goblins aren't renowned navigators at the best of times, and this fact,
coupled with the exceptionally poor condition of the map, makes most of
it illegible and highly suspect. However, several of the markings seem to
fit with what little you know of local geography, and doubtless some of
the landmarks are general knowledge to the locals.

Les Foret d'Mort~
Twisted, gnarled trees hang low over the rutted path, becoming increasingly
decayed and blackened as the path heads deeper into what is known as
the Forest of the Dead. Few have ventured into this fell wood, and even
fewer have returned to tell about it. Birds and forest animals shun this
place, as if they could not stand to be too close less they become cursed
or infected with the evil contained within. The sun cannot be seen overhead,
obscured as it is by the dark, gnarled branches of the nearby trees, which
are so obscured and mutated by evil that not even a druid would be able to
determine their original species. A weatherbeaten sign has been nailed to one
of these trees, to the left of the path.

A Dark Junction~
A short way into the cursed wood, the rutted path splits, with a new
fork cutting into the thick undergrowth to the east, while the original
path continues north. The forest is utterly still, no animal cries or
bird calls fill the air, nor even the movement of anything through the
undergrowth, save for the noise your own feet make as you slowly progress

An Overgrown Path~
Progress is difficult here, as the rampant undergrowth almost totally
obscures the path, the spiny fronds and spiky thorns tearing at flesh
and clothing, leaving you a bleeding, cursing wreck after only twenty
paces. It appears that no one has come this way in years, though something
had to clear the once-broad path in the first place.

The path ends suddenly, in a small clearing, which is stained with dried
blood and white bones, showing through a pile of garbage and decaying
plant matter. Peering closely, you are astonished when the pile appears to
move towards you, ever so slightly. Shaking your heard, you shrug and attribute
it to an optical illusion engendered by stress and fatigue. seconds before you
feel a leafy frond grope at your ankles...

directions, proceeding deeper into the forest to the east and west,
and to the outside world to the south. Tracks in the dirt, made by
heavy footed humanoids, lead east and west. Some of them have been
made by rather narrow feet, as of skeletons or such.

as in most parts of this dark place. No tracks can be seen heading in

a variety of dessicated corpses, trapped and drained of their blood
over the years by the presumably huge spiders that constructed this
macabre lair. Ranging from small hobbits to towering half-trolls, you

to travel faster than a cautious walk. Blood stains can be seen at

Another Dead End~
So many of the paths and trails in this depressing forest seem to end
in dead ends, or worse, so you aren't terribly surprised when this one
does too. And most of the time these dead ends contain numerous threats
to your continued existence on this plane; you doubt this one will be any

Frequent Slaughter~
As you duck and weave around more and more common piles of broken
weapons and slaughtered humanoids, the legends of this forest begin
to come back to mind. Centuries ago, during the Dark Ages when Chaos
threatened the very existence of Brythunia and the Estroglian Empire,
a massive battle, one of many such battles, was fought on the grounds
now covered by this forest. The armies of Law marshalled here to defend
the Elven Kingdoms to the south from the hordes from the north. Hundreds
of thousands of lives were lost during the Dark Ages, but no battle
claimed more in a single day than the slaughter that occured here, in
the lands that the Elves enchanted to blossom with flower and tree to
cover the stain on their lands. The deaths that occured here carried strong
necromantic magicks, however, and the forest quickly became corrupted and
reduced to the state you now behold.

A Crossroads~
At this point several paths converge, allowing one to head in any
of the cardinal directions. The path to the north ends at the wooden
gates of a stockade, which has become badly overgrown as the garrison
that was stationed there has long since fallen to the evil that roams
unhindered in this dark wood. Despite having fallen prey to the forces
of nature, much of the stockade still stands, a testament to the sturdiness
of Elven fortifications.

A Narrow Trail~
Plunging deeper into the forest, you cannot help but pause and wonder
if this is such a great idea; serious threat for little perceived
financial gain, and the possibility of losing what you already own
to boot. Ah well, 'tis good that you are made of sterner stuff, and
bravely enter where others fear to tread... what's the bit about fools

indistinct black mass, with no coherent form that you can easily

the trail here; few people indeed have dared (or been able) to venture
this deep into the forest. A foul stench, of rotting vegetable matter,
fills the air; blocked perpetually from the sun as this area is, the
dying vegetation is allowed to fester indefinitely with nothing to dry
it out and dispel the odors.

unindentifiable humanoid heading away from a clearing to the north.
The tracks head into the undergrowth nearby, and don't appear to
have returned, indicating that the clearing ahead is most likely
deserted, and may well be a good place to rest for a while. Gazing at
the footprints reminds you of how tired your own aching feet are, and
you long to sit down and take off your boots, at least for a few minutes.

stench. Looking about, you wonder where the perpetrator of these dark deeds

An Older Section of the Forest~
At this point the path beneath your feet slowly changes from dirt to
broken, cracked masonry. Crumbling statues line the path, almost totally
overgrown by the thick black vines you are now so familiar with. A lingering
musty odor fills the air, and you realize that you have stumbled upon the
remains of some ancient city, long since devoured by the forest and its
evil inhabitants. To the southwest, you can now make out a series of ruined
dwellings, crumbling stone structures almost totally overgrown by the forest.
Small creatures scurry about, in search of food or shiny objects. A rusted
metal sign has been nailed to a tree near the statues.

Stepping onto the stone road, you almost feel that you have been
transported back in time. Despite the ruin and overgrowth, many of
the structures still display the remarkable architectural features
endemic to this period of history, and are actually in quite good
condition considering the surroundings. It was rumored that the ancients
used magical beings as servants and guards, and that their cities fell
when these beings threw off the shackles of servitude and slew their
former masters. You are not an expert in Brythunian history, but you'd
be willing to bet some of these unruly automatons were responsible for
much of the damage done to this once-fair city, and then the evil forest
did the rest.

The path here is interrupted by the occurence of a slowly flowing river
of what appears to be green slime, flowing from a large pool to the
northwest, across the path, disappearing into the undergrowth to the
southeast; the plants and trees glow with a strange hue where the slime
has made contact with them. A vile, putrid odor, too strong to bear at
times, wafts in from the northwest and accompanies the foul stream on its
course. Nothing could live in such water, surely?

Bubbles, created by some unknown source, rise to the surface at random

odors. In the midst of this foul pool resides some terrible beast, doubtless
responsible for the remains of several humanoids dangling from the thick
canopy of trees overhead. Occasionally a chunk of decayed flesh will fall
from one of the corpses and sink in the pool without trace.

running due north, lined on each side by glowing marble statues in
pristine condition. The statues look vaguely familiar to you, and
as you approach you realize that they are similar to the ones found
in many of the cities of the ancients across Brythunia, save that 
instead of showing considerable signs of age and neglect, they appear to
be brand new. This curious occurence is compounded by the fact that not
a single branch or leaf touches the road at any point; some magical force
prevents any growth from obscuring it.

last night's drinking bout at the Hammer and Anvil left your wits a little
fuddled. Or maybe you just weren't paying attention. At any rate, your
normally alert adventurer's sixth sense was definitely not operating up to
acceptable standards; you failed to notice the birds fleeing nearby trees,
as if some hidden monster lurked within, you failed to notice the loop of
vine carefully concealed beneath a pile of uncharacteristically dry leaves,
and you failed to notice the dull gleam of drawn swords. Before you knew
it, you had stepped on the trap, been yanked upside down into the air, and
left dangling as several giggling forest goblins emerged, and slowly stabbed
and slashed you until naught remained but a bleeding, screaming mass of
flesh, looted and left for the vultures to pick clean.

with dried blood. Bones and broken weapons litter the ground around the
base of the tower, the remains of the unfortunate souls who once
garrisoned this outpost, and some of their enemies they managed to
slay before they fell. A chill wind blows over the ruins, and a keening
wail from somewhere far away can be heard. The spirits of those slain
here do not rest easily, you can be certain, and are making themselves
heard as best they can in their non-corporeal states. Shivering, you
cast one last glance at this ruin, and decide which way to proceed.

to the north. After a moment's confusion, you suddenly realize that
you have reached the easternmost extend of the Walls of Defiance,
the massive stone structure that protects the northern plains of
Estroglian from the Hordes of the north. The sound of running water
reaches your ears, and you realise that the Phlugistrum flows by
close to the east of here, though a thick wall of vegetation prevents
you from reaching it.

Suddenly, literally out of nowhere, the trail ends at a small thatch
hut, buried in the forest, not visible from more than a few yards away
due to the thick, heavy undergrowth and the shadows of surrounding trees.
Smoke billowing from the chimney indicates at least some form of
occupation, be it friendly or malign. The front door is closed, but doesn't
appear to be locked (not that a locked door has ever stopped you from

Sinister Vegetation~
The path here is as twisted and warped as the gnarled blackened branches
that the dark trees on either side have given issue to. Frequently it
feels as if they are almost attempting to grab you, and drag you into
their evil domain. Roots protruding from the ground catch at your feet,
and more than once you almost end up face down on the ground.

A Stone Arch~
The path ends here, before a stone arch set into the side of a small
hillock. Peering in between the stone supports, you see a narrow
stairway descending into the darkness below, towards a tomb, perhaps,
or the lair of some intelligent underground-dwelling species. Either
way, you suspect that they wouldn't be partial to visitors.

The Base of the Stair~
The steps end before a rusted iron door, set in the earth of the west
wall. A keyhole is present, but nature has rendered it unusuable over
the centuries, so even if you had the correct key it would serve no
purpose. A single rune, the rune of Death, has been carved into the door,
visible even through the heavy corrosion. A thin layer of moisture can
also be perceived, the type of condensation common to metal exposed to
cold temperatures for extended periods, the water forming a sheath as
a result.

A Chilly Crypt~
The interior of the cramped crypt contains a single stone tomb, a 
sarcophagus bearing an inlaid image of the necromancer it houses. Runes
and sigils cover the walls, traced in luminiscent silver, gold and platinum.
Images, vile images, of death, dismemberment and other evil acts cover the
ceiling, as if it was created for the dead body to take pleasure in during
its eternal rest. An unnatural cold fills the room, from an unknown source;
icicles have formed in parts of the damp chamber as a result.

A Messy Dwelling~
You haven't been inside such a messy dwelling since you visited an orcish
village in your youth, and even then they at least had the benefit of not
knowing any better. The cranky elf who lives here, however, should and 
indeed does know better; she is simply too lazy and disorganized to clean
the dirty pots, piles of paper and animal stains from the walls and floor.

Outside the Stockade~
Upon closer examination, you are surprised to see that much of the
stockade is still intact; the tactician in you says that someone managed
to sneak in and unlock the gates, allowing the enemy outside to pour in
virtually unhindered, slaughtering the surprised inhabitants before they
could be called to arms. A devilish, but gruesomely effective, tactic.
You wonder also what forces yet remain within these wooden walls?

The Stockade~
Stepping through the gate, you are greeted by a visage of death and
destruction. Half-devoured corpses in various stages of decay lie
everywhere, surrounded by their broken weapons and smashed armor. 
Hardly any corpses appear to be of any race but elven; only one or
two badly rotted corpse appear to be remains of the enemy that took
this place. Whatever overran this place was swift, efficient and deadly.
The elves didn't stand a chance. A set of steps leads up to a watchtower,
while open doorways to the east and west lead into quarters of the
garrison. A second door lies to the north, leading to the officers' 
area. It doesn't appear to have been disturbed...

The Watchtower~
Once the lookout tower for the stockade garrison, this position was
safe from the ground, but quite vulnerable to aerial attacks, which
was the fate of the unfortunate soul stationed here when the garrison
was finally crushed by the evil forces of the forest. Huge gouges mar
the wooden structure, as of the claws of some powerful creature. Blood
is spattered on the roof and the floor, the result of deep slashes made
by these same claws in elven flesh.

Surprised at the lack of obvious effort made by the invaders to
break ino this area, you are even more surprised by the sight that
greets you when you pass easily through the unlocked door. Bodies
lie sprawled on the floor, bearing no obvious injuries but with
grimaces of horror and pain contorting their faces into terrible
ritcuses of unpleasant death. Some being managed to pass through the
walls and slay the defenders of the commander, with little effort.
You grip your weapon firmly and wonder if it still remains nearby...

near a window looking out onto dense forest. You frown, knowing that
the woodlands you see are certainly not the ones that surround this
place, and quickly deduce that this is an optical illusion, cleverly

in comparison to those of the enemy shows that this clearly was not the

Little save the stone of this place survived the onslaught of the golems
as they rampaged over the dwellings of their former masters; shards of
broken glass, pottery and other debris litters the road everywhere you
go, making this rubble-strewn causeway a precarious path to follow.
The sounds of stone meeting with stone from nearby indicates that they

A Ruined Chapel~
When the temple was violated and the priests slain by the golems, the
blessings that once held sway here began to falter, then as the populace
lost faith in the gods who had failed to protect them in their hour of
need it manifested itself in a representation of dark and malicious 
thoughts, compounded with fear and betrayal, and all the emotions that
only worsen a person coalesced into an immortal entity that now inhabits
this once-sacred ground, a bitter irony as the temple was once that of a
god of love, light and life.

Judging by the size of this structure, or what remains of it, this
must once have been the residence of someone of significant importance
in the city; the mayor, perhaps, or the high priest of the temple. At
any rate, it appears to have survived better than most of the other
structures, a statement of either its structural integrity or the 
result of some latent programming of the golems that still prevents them
from levelling it.

noble at the fate of her city (she has been dead so long all have now

now haunts this place.

and you fancy you can hear a faint humming coming from within. It seems

Suddenly your light source flares into full light, as you step past

black chamber, the walls of which writhe and moan as if they were alive.
The floor is slick with blood and gore, and you notice to your horror
that so are your hands and booted feet. Blood covers most of you, in
fact, thick clumps matting your hair and staining your armor. Shrieking,
you scarcely notice the other horrors this chamber conceals. The only
other feature your slightly unhinged mind detects is the presence of two
doors, in the east and west walls, and a staircase to the north.

Before you is a large, arched hall, the vaulted ceilings over sixty feet in
height. Several iron wrought chandeliers, laden with unlit candles, depend
from hooks set in the supports, while the grey stone walls bear elaborate
murals of pain, death and mutilation. Several items are displayed here, as
grotesque museum exhibits, including an iron maiden, a rack, several tables
laden with manacles and iron masks, and an iron chair. The air is musty, and
carries the faint taint of putrescent flesh; apparently not all of this
equipment was cleaned before being placed here. Flickering light can be seen

The hall continues, widening slightly here, where the entire northern
wall is made of a series of panes of glass, framed with iron bars.
Peering through the glass, you peer out onto a desolate landscape, the
forest below shrouded in mist caused by a perpetual rain. Dark stormclouds
hover menacingly overhead, broken only by the black metal spire of a tower
that rises northwest of here, framed in lightning at random intervals.
Deep, booming laughter reverberates through the hall, though it could just
be thunder. Ghostly spectral shapes flicker back and forth outside, pelted
by the incessant rain and scattered by the occasional lightning strike.
Sometimes one will flit closer to you, and stare with empty eyesockets at
you, imploring you to help release it from its undead state.

The hall narrows again here, to the dimensions of the museum of torture,
and is very similar in appearance, save that this chamber is filled with
large stone sarcophagii, all open, revealing the perfectly preserved
remains of unknown mages and priests from times forgotten. Peering closer,
you are relieved to note that they appear to be quite dead, and not about
to leap forth and attack you, unlike the other "corpses" you have encountered
in the forest of the walking dead. The hall continues for a short distance 
to the west, where it ends at an arched entranceway.

around, soaring higher into the tower, which is obviously much larger
than it appeared from the view you glimpsed through the window earlier.
Either that, or some fell enchantment is at work ...WHOA! You shriek as
your concentration slips during your musings, and you lose your footing.
Scrabbling furiously, you manage to leap to the next step, and glance 
back at the pile of debris that was once supporting your foot as it
plummets into the inky darkness below. Wiping your brow with relief, you
collect yourself and continue.

The Ancient Star~
At this point you surmise that you are almost near the top; the stairs
show considerably less signs of wear (indicating that few adventurers
made it this far) and you fancy you can hear loud breathing coming
from a dark chamber that is now coming into view at the top of the stair.
Smiling with relief, you hasten your pace, and ready yourself for the
next challenge Cresslix' domain will hurl at you.

A Massive Chamber~
The staircase ends here, at the southern end of a massive stone chamber,
the walls and floor of which are covered in deep, savage claw marks, as
of some gargantuan beast sharpening its claws, perhaps in preparation for
battle or feasting? Piles of skulls, as high as your waist, have been 
arranged at regular intervals around the perimeter of the area, a grim
reminder of the killing power of whatever beast resides here.

The Glowing Sphere~
The chamber ends here, before a gaping hole in the ceiling, which is
filled with a glowing translucent sphere. Although it crackles and
shimmers with powerful magicks, the energy surging from it doesn't do
you any noticeable harm. There doesn't appear to be any other way onwards
except through whatever this sphere keeps in place.

Halls of Peril~
Dark, shifting walls press in on all sides of you here, threatening to
engulf you. Not a sound permeates the dizzying, moving dark shapes, nor
does your light source penetrate far into the gloom. Shapes move about on
all sides of you, adding to your confusion. Panic sets in as you also realize
that in this evil place your magic will not function either.

The Sanctum of Evil~
The panel opens onto a small chamber, no more than a dozen feet on
each side, which contains naught but a small slab of obsidian, set in
the middle of a blazing pentagram of fire. Smoke fills the room, causing
you to choke and gag, while the heat from the pentagram is quickly becoming
unbearable. What manner of being would reside in such a fell domain?
