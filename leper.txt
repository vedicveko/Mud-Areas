This is a fair-sized island out in a secluded part of the sea which is
populated by lepers who have been banished or thrown out of their
homeland. This was mainly built as a good place for high levels to get
experience. The few objects that are there are meant to be fairly
good in stats, as this zone was built to be difficult.
