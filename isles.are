The frozen captive is so gratified by your kindness that

area, and had major writers block. Well, Simba sort of 
nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look 
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of 
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

You stand in the hall of the pirate lord. Above on a dias is a desk and
a chair. Where you are is a table with 9 chairs around it. On the walls
are charts of the seas, and various mounted fish. To the east is a barracks
area, and to the west is an iron gate. Stairs wind upwards into a shaft
from which hot air emanates. It is up these stairs that most of the pirates
scurry when you enter the room.

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this 
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells, 
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now. 
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by 
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'
