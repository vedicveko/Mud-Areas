Madame Log~
Madame Log~
Madame Log says, "the owls are not what they appear to be".
~
This petite lady is in her early 50s and can communicate with logs, 
especially ones that pitch tents.  She has told Kooper and company
that on the night of Laura's murder her log-- via empathic communication
with the woods-- saw lights and owls and heard screams.  You wonder
what else, besides finding out what goes on in the woods, she uses
that log for.

Jarring John Jenault wants revenge on Kooper, so what.
~
John has a French-Canadian accent like his brothers.  He blames Kooper
for the deaths of his 2 brothers.  He is a wicked character and has
committed every vile act little ole angelic you can think of and then
some.  I think his mother used to beat him when he was a kid: he
grew to like this.

I'll have a better chance of recovering the money faster.  Lexy looks

Kamal to believe that I need bail money... She probably will because
he is a sucker for pretty girls.  He is so glued to the front desk that
he probably wouldn't notice me even if I happened to auto-wander into
the same room that he is in.  By the way, I am dancing tonight at Deja-Vu

Robert Rikard the Fortean~
Robert Rikard the Fortean discusses why the X-Files is Fortean
~
Like if you dont already know, the X-files is Fortean because it deals with
ETs, extra-terrestrials, not Entropy, in case some of here mud, the Jersey
Devil, the face on Mars, voodoo, alien implants, telepathy, inherited
memories and vampyrism to name just a few topics.  By the way, has Bassam
remembered the the way to make Bahama Mamas yet?  In addition, I dont
really think Laura Palmer is dead, I believe she was abducted by aliens,
and that they left a dead duplicate of her for us so that we would not be
suspicious.  They are probably using her for breeding experiments and if
you dont believe me it is because you are closed minded and part
of a govermental conspiracy.  You would probably like to kill me
because of my beliefs huh?  or maybe just for xp?

Damn, I cant find my friend and a fellow Fortean Robert Rikard.  Those
ETs are up to no good again.  They are probably going to experiment on
him and then put implants in him so they can keep track of him when they
bring him back to earth.  Maybe he will get a chance to see Laura
Palmer and see whether the breeding experiment turned out ok.

I dont know what I am doing here, I was in Australia just a minute ago...
Must be those damn extra-terrestrials the Forteans are always talking about
who transported me here...  Last thing I remember my dog Ginger Lynn was
digging holes in my yard and chewing on my tennis shoes...  Damn, did I say
dog, I meant dingo, I still think like I am in America, wait, I am in the US
now.  Loony tunes, it was 24 hours ago when my dingo was digging those
holes.  Damn, ETs must have transported me here, I have experienced "missing
time".  Anyways, DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT FIGHTING ME, I may not have much
experience as the others here but I have become extremely virile by taking
nutritional supplements daily for the past 4 years, and as always, I took
the best.  The cold still makes me weak though.

Sunshine~
Sunshine is cleaning up and tells you "I like Tom Cruise"
~
Tom Cruise is a way better actor than Brad Pitt and is like way better
looking in my humble opinion.  Still I feel that both are way too short
for me because I am 6'4" with high-heels on and I never take them off, 
even when sleeping, and they are essential to my night job as a dancer.
I heard that the person who killed Laura Palmer has an excellent pair
of high-heels and I wish I could find her or him (possibly a cross-
dresser).  It is rumored that an agoraphobic person has Laura Palmer's
diary, which contain's clues as to who killed her.  I wonder who this
person who has her diary is?  I have heard much from the people who
frequent this hotel but this person's whereabouts or name has not been
mentioned.  Oh well, I guess I'll continue cleaning up and maybe I'll
hear something new about this person.  "Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Staying Alive,
Staying Alive...."

It was probably a man who killed our dear sweet Laura Palmer.  I hear tell
that his name is Bo or something like that.  If only we could find the
parts of her diary and the audio tapes she made for Dr. Jakoby we could
probably figure out which man is responsible for her death.  He is
probably one of the powerful city leaders who has kept us oppressed.

Maybe I should find out what that muttering about Laura Palmer is all
about since you seem unwilling to do so.  I remember seeing Laura at
the Roadhouse a couple of weeks ago and the nasty things she was doing
with this stranger made me feel young again.  What I would not have given
to be in his shoes: at least as much as I have spent on lap dances at
Leggs in the past 20 years, which must be close to $5,000 dollars
I believe.  Anyways, I hope Kamal does not want to borrow any more
money from me because I already lent him more than Bassam has and it's
getting to the point where I wont have enough money to buy alcohol and
lap dances, and then I'll have no life at all and would kindly ask you
to put me out of my misery, but not until then, ok?

You are looking at a short, full-figured, extremely sexy-- I mean I am

and you can see her sway slowly, erotically and dreamily to mood music
whenever it is playing.  She is in love with Dale Kooper but he sees
himself as a father figure/friend to her (he must surely be crazy).
She is the daughter of Ten Horn and is working, like you, on finding
the killer of Laura Palmor.  Many are investigating Laura's death because
by doing so they will discover much about themselves and their friends
and family since everyone was connected to Laura in someway.  In a way,
is not all humanity connected?  And can we not learn much by exploring
people and life instead of just leveling all of the time?

It's amazing how much Maddalin looks like her cousin Laura.  She got an

We know who has the tape and we made a video of Maddalin disguised as Laura
telling this person that Laura wants to meet secretly with him.  This 
will allow Donna and I to search for the tape while they are at the meeting
place.  He should take the bait because  the sexual things Laura talked 
about on tape would make any straight man want to believe that she is still
alive.  I am the sweetest guy in the world.  Laura would hit me some times,
but I like it when she did.  I am courting Donna now, but unfortunately she
is not a sadist.  I will have to adapt, but I can always pay a visit to

The White Priestess Nadeen Burly intones "Judicandus erectus"
~
Nadeen is a tall, slim, red head.  She is married to Big Head Burly
and is the inventor of silent drape-runners, which were made silent
when Big Head accidently dropped some substance on them when he came 
home.  She is nuts, and so are we all, but not as much as she is.
After her overdose, which gave her great strength and made her believe
she was a teenager again, she fell in love with Mike.

You see Laura Palmor's mom. She is always seeing visions of unicorns and

Her husband Leyland loves his family but often gets violent with them
and does not remember that he has gotten violent.   Sarah is often crying
over the death of her daughter and you feel like it is euthanasia time.

died after killing Eckbard at his suite.  Eckbard knew that she'd kill
him to rid herself of him or because Catt and Andrewg has her under their
control now and they hate Eckbard because of his schemes.  Well, how Josee
died is a mystery.  Hairy was deeply depressed afterwards.  Eckbard got
the last laugh on Andrewg however, leaving him a saftey deposit box key
that exploded when he opended it, and my Audrey was there when the explosion
took place, so if you see Andrew before I do......

has offered to help her get revenge based on the love they first had
when they met.  Personally, if I were in Peat's shoes, I would have asked
Catt for money.

Also, this spirit refers to the one-armed man as Mike, which is the name of
Mobby's friend Mike Half-Nelson.  This might not mean anything but I am
running out of description ideas.  Weird also is the fact that my ex-friend,
who betrayed me, used to name his pain Mike.  Anyways, the bird bites on

that could be used to find Laura's killer and that was how Waldoh was

Catt is the sister of supposedly deceased Andrewg Packhard.  Andrewg Married
Josee, who was working for Andrewg's business rival Thomass Eckbard,
who got Josee to kill Andrewg, or so it seemed that he was killed to
all but Andrewg.  Thus, Josee inherited the Packhard Sawmill, but was
still, Josee was, under the control of Thomass.  Catt got pissed because
Josee got the mill and her relationship with her husband Peat was going
down hill so she started to sleep with Ten and scheming with him on
business ventures and eventually they each double crossed each other.
The more you learn about these people the more you like them, but still
you kill them, why is that?

and Maddalin broke into Harold's house to get Laura's diary and Harold
went nuts and killed himself, because he held that diary as sacred.
Still, Harold did not blame Donna because he understood why she did
it, but he still held that diary sacred, I think.  Anyways he is

This huge rotund man has 4 chins and drools all of the time.  He is a
black-jack dealer at One-Eyed Flaps casino, he runs cocaine across the
border with Leoh Donson and he bartends here, doh.  He and Leoh were
having sex with Laura and Funnette before Laura was killed.  Soon, he
will be killed by Leyland because Leyland will think Jack killed Laura.
But before he gets killed, I believe that he will have 5 last suppers
at once at The Timber Room.

She is kind of skinny but she is a vision of loveliness.  She lost the

a vegetable via a severe injury, she and Mobby used to make love in front
of Leoh thinking that he would not be able understand what they were doing,
and they would make fun of him.  I guess he deserved what he got.  Leoh
eventually came to his senses and risked his life in order to save
Jelly from Winsome Earle's evil scheme.  It's nice to see that people
can change for the better, blessed be the Rose clan.

{yThis area is a satire of the best television show of all time, Twin
Peaks.  The area is dedicated to all those who had anything to do with
making the show, and to Wink and Freak, who allowed me to make one of my
dreams come true.  The area is level 50-90.  It is the first area I ever
made.  It was made for the mud Eternity's Trials.  Have fun!  --Dimi{x

Dead Dog Farm~
{Y In this farm house you see a sink with baby laxative residue in it and
believe that either a baby needed care here or someone was messing with
cocaine.  Kooper would love to buy this place but for the time being
he would like to see if he can catch some cocaine dealers if coke is 
indeed what the baby laxative is associated with.  John Jenault looks
like the type that would deal in coke and you better hurry up and kill
him because I believe that if you dont one of Kooper's associates might
beat you to it.{x

wondering about who killed laura Palmer.  A person playing "Clue" suggests
that the Butler killed Laura.  This person's "Clue" opponent then bonks
him over the head with the gameboard for making such a moronic suggestion
and says: "she didn't have a butler, it was the plumber who did it."
A knight tells his fellow knights "watching Nirvana relaxes me, those
Muslims wont stand a chance against us in the next Crusade."{x

those with "wimpy set high" appetites, the homemade granola is excellent.
Local businessmen can always be seen here for lunch and they are always
raving over the chili.  For Dinner, Jerry horn has added exotic dishes
from all over the world to the already humongous menu.  But if you are
not in the mood for the bizarre, stick to the stuffed baked dove, fried
rabbit, wild roast duck or braised venison.  And songs have been written
in tribute to the garlic cheese grits.{x

is assembled and you hear a lot of men being cursed by the women here.  The
venom and bile being spammed out by these women seems appropriate for they
have all been treated poorly by some of the men of Twin Peaks.  They are
discussing ways in which they can wrest power from the unscrupulous men who
control the city.  One feels that if they succeed the city would not become
much better, but any improvement would be a step in the right direction.

This one seems to be in better shape than it is kept by the Inn's help.  
The smell of fresh coffee, donuts and teenage lust is in the air.{x

Room 240 of the Great Northern~
{r This room contains the fresh corpses of Edward the Confessor and Hirally
Crinton.  They killed each other recently over an argument on birth control.
It seems that Edward won a small victory for "right to life" advocates in
that He and Hirally will no longer be capable of bringing children into
the world.{x

2nd Floor Hallway~
{R This Hallway continues to the south and there are rooms to the east and
west of you.  Monks and little boys fled here from the west.  They went
east but soon afterwards they fled back here and then fled south to safety.
To the south you hear a monk say "hmmm, no easy way to go north, and I
forgot my jar of vasoline in Room 250".  Every so often you see an vile-
looking spirit floating east and west of here.  To the east you hear a
lovely sounding feminine voice.  Every so often this voice becomes 
masculine- and bellicose-sounding.  You decide to see whether or not
the person whom this voice belongs to needs the phone number of Skiddsy,
a sex-change specialist from the realms of Eternal Chaos.  Before you go
east, you hear another monk to the south say "What do you mean no easy way
to go north, there is no way to go north at all from here".  Suddenly,
a door is conjured up to the south by someone.{x

Room 250 of The Great Northern~
{B After performing their famous chants at The Roadhouse last night, the
Gregorian monks appear to have come back here and trashed the room.  It
seems as though they behave not too differently than rock stars of the
late 1900s.  The boys tied up in the room dont seem to happy about what
the monks did either.  Dale "Bob" Kooper enters the room and the boys and
monks run from him in fear.  Dale heads to the bathroom nearby, since he 
ate too many donuts recently, and you see him smash his face against the
mirror in there and say "Is Annie ok, is Annie ok....".  Unlike the
monks, you are NOT afraid of Dale because his Bob "side" is momentarily
gone, and you decide to go West and comfort him, dont you?{x

You are in a clean room that contains two beds, a bathroom, a desk and
most importantly, a TV.  You hear singing coming from somewhere, and it
sounds like a duck is being stepped on.  On TV, you see that the Magna Carta
has been signed, and you cannot be more happy about the power you have gained.

did it, who, who".  Oregon White Oaks, Paper Birches and Rocky Mountain
Maples line the streets.  Occasionally you can see a raccoon running
around trying to find its way back into the woods.  A Pine weasel
is wondering where the Pine Trees are.  One can buy food to the east and gas
to the west.  The residential district is north of here.{x

and everyone is drinking some.  Seats in every booth are upholstered
in attractive and stain-resistant vinyl and on every table there are
salt and pepper shakers, sugar, cream (always fresh and full), ketchup,
mustard, a napkin dispenser and an ashtray.  The juke-box in the north-
east corner is playing Julie Cruise's "The Nightingale", to which Audrey
Horn is slowly swaying as on-lookers gawk at her.  It is currently
lunch time and people are scarfing up what looks to be the best meal
one could get anywhere, which includes the Timber Room surprisingly.{x

wander around wondering where their fellow weasel ran off to: they seem
worried and start to sing songs of sorrow.  A Great Horned Owl tells them in
interspecies ornitho-speak "Shut up, I'm trying to think".  To the east you
hear cries of anguish 24 hours a day.  Ozzie and Harriet like things can be
heard off to the west.  Kids appear to be torturing each other to the north.
There appears to be something flying over your head.{x

the Palmors.  Leyland Palmor scammed it off of a little old lady for 1/2
of what it was worth.  After he scammed it, he said he did not realise that
he took that old lady for a ride.  The walls of the home have holes in them
that look like they have been made by fists, faces, heads, legs, and arms
having been thrown through them.  Leyland does not seem to know how the
holes got there but by looking at his wife you seem to have a good idea

coffee before you continue on your journey.  In the corner you see
a machine that continually makes donuts and coffee of every type and
it seems that is all the people in the station eat.  The donuts are
made with olestra so although they are not fattening they account for
the reason why there is a bathroom connected to every room.  The coffee
also accounts for this.  You suddenly feel the urge to go potty.{x

anywhere.  The odor of fear comes from the east.  An owl appears out
of nowhere and screeches, "I've seen people slide eastward on oil, but I've
never seen them come back, and my vision is 20/20".  Suddenly, you trip
over something.{x

Harold's Living Room~
{B This living room is very cozy.  It includes a fireplace, a leather couch
and love seats and bookshelves with tons of books on them.  You have heard
rumours that the man who lives here NEVER leaves this house.  You have
also heard that while he is afraid of most people, he nevertheless loved
to hear Laura tell him about her wild escapades.  So I guess if you are
a female and have some wild stories to tell him, he would not fear you.
If you are male, then he would not like you being here.{x

and suffering.  The townfolk hope that you will be able to find and 
destroy this spirit so that they can once again live in peace.  To the

direction a bit but you know you can handle it.  An owl flies towards you

the imperfection that you need to kill in order to achieve perfection".

There is a lever in one of the cave's walls that was revealed when Deputy
Andy Brennun swung his axe at an owl that frightened him when it flew
through the cave.  Andy, incompetent as he usually is, missed the owl and
hit the wall of the cave.  After he left, Winsome Earl came by and rotated
the lever thereby causing the symbols on the nearby mural to become
inverted.  An owl arrived from downwards after being very pleased by what
Winsome did and kissed him on the cheek.  Made ecstatic by the kiss, Winsome
levitated upwards.  {x

Mrs. Tremound's Home~
{B This house is decorated very conservatively for Mrs. Tremound is a 
conservative little old lady.   Before she was killed, Laura Palmor
delivered food to Mrs. Tremound daily for the "Meals for Feels" program,
which was run by Norma Jenningsly of the Double D Diner.  Mrs. Tremound's
grandson especially misses Laura's visits... I wonder why?  Donna Wayward
has replaced Laura and Mrs. Tremound's grandson performs an eerie magic
trick which she is not at all amused by.  He has made a salami disappear and
Donna does not like where it has disappeared to.  Tremound's grandson
exclaims "Laura used to beg me to do that trick, what's your problem".
Donna slaps him hard and he does "the silly walk" and collapses on the
floor.  Donna asks Mrs. Tremound if she knew Laura well.  Mrs. Tremound responds
"No, my grandson did but he's out cold now.  My neighbor Harold knew her
well though, but he is not very easy to talk to".  Donna says "thanks",
kicks the grandson and leaves.{X

A Bridge Over Troubled Water~
{r You are on a bridge made of rusty iron.  Below the bridge the water is 
muddy-colored in some places and crimson in other spots.  It may be that
time of the month again, a time when the moon is full and bloodlust runs
rampant, but then again it may just be that someone has spilled some
paint into the water.{x

Fleeting Flowery Fearful Field~
{b You think you are on a fickle field but the field keeps changing its
emotions and terrain and it is dark so it is hard for you to tell.  The
night is as black as coffee without cream or sugar but you think you see a
railroad track with a beat-up railway car on it.  The bad vibes emanating
from the car make you feel that something vile has happened here recently,
and you are turned on and disgusted simultaneously.  You wish you had a
flashlight so you could see more and be able to penetrate some of the some
of the darkness nearby.  You should visit the hardware store more often.{x

Jolly Jaundiced Jack Jenault's J'Cabin~
{m This cabin is a mess.  There is a cuckoo clock, ripped panties,
cocaine, a fire place, rotten food, a birdcage with no bottom and a record
player playing some menacing music in here.  The evil that has taken place
in here was so overpowering that it almost seems otherwordly, or so you
sense it to have been from the strong atmosphere it has left behind.  In
fact, you just now feel a sense of evil coming from the west.  {x
