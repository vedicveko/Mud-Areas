The Secret Garden~
This small garden is built on the roof of part of the Players' Rooms.
Lush green grass softly ripples around your legs, while unseen birds
serenade you with their sweet song.  On the bushes that encompass this
area, small, brightly-coloured butterflies flutter back and forth,
while a soft breeze helps to keep you cool and relaxed.

On A High Up Ledge~
This small, narrow ledge is constructed out of metal, and forms a walkway
around the Observation Room to the East.  From here, you seem uninterested
in the amazing view, and more worried about not falling to the ground, many
tens of feet below you.

The Observation Room~
This small room is situated above the level of the Player's Rooms, and the
adjacent Temple and buildings of Midgaard.
Circular in shape, with a domed roof, this room offers clear views across
Midgaard and the surrounding area.  Far off to the West, you can sometimes
watch the Sun glint off the ocean.
 
There are no walls as such here; instead the whole room appears to be
constructed out of the finest quality glass.  Outside the windows, a
small metal walkway encircles the structure, although you are unable to
work out any way to gain access to it.  Even if you could, balancing on
such a thin strip of metal this high up could be tricky...  Instead, why
not just sit a while, and enjoy the view, letting your worries fade away?

who never appears to be over or underworked.  Stools line the bar, and the rest
of the room is occupied by small and large tables, with an assortment of
chairs surrounding them.  A small spiral staircase leads up.
