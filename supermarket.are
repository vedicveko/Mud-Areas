Marlboro Menthol, the girl sneers and points to a large sign on the register.
She dosen't think you are old enough?!? Well, I dont think I would stand for

The Ice-Cream Aisle~
You stand in the frigid ice-cream aisle. Brrrrr it's cold here. This 
seems to be the feeding ground for the seriously overweight. Watch out,
if you get between one of them and their 'Rocky Road' ice cream, it's not
a pretty sight.

The Dairy Aisle~
Enormous quantities of milk and cheese unfold before you. You wonder how
the few cows in Aesir could produce so much. It is truly Reardon's Utopia, 
and a nightmare for the lactose intolerant.

The Produce Aisle~
Fresh fruits and vegetables are piled high all around you. They 
have the biggest kiwi display you think you have ever seen. As you
wander through this maze of produce, you wonder if you still know
your way out of here.

The Canned Goods Aisle~
The shelves here are mostly empty, due to a lazy stockboy no doubt.
The floor is littered with expired coupons and you have to be careful
to step around burst cans of chili on the floor. Ewww.

The Soft Drink Aisle~
There are shelves upon shelves of various soft drinks you have never
heard of. The floor is quite sticky, and to your discust you notice 
several large cockroaches have been caught in it.

The Wine and Hard Liquor Aisle~
The pride of Aesir Winn Dixie. This is the most alcohol you have ever
seen in one place. Millions of bottles of wine, spiced rum, whiskey...
...anything you could want. Be careful though, any underage mortal
that tries to buy alcohol gets 6 hours jailtime if caught.

Beauty Aids Aisle~
Better described perhaps as the 'shallow female aisle'. Shallow females
wander about, zombie-like, trying to find the perfect lotion to make
them beautiful. Superficiality seems to have gotten a foothold here.
Be careful, don't let them suck you in...remember: You are beautiful
-just the way you are-.

The Cereal Aisle~
What an incredible selection of cold cereal! From 'Bran Balls' to 'Captain 
Cavity', it's all here. You hear a child pestering her mother for a box of 
sugar-coated-caramel-filled-cookie-flavored bran flakes and you realize
the people here are beginning to irritate you.

The Frozen Dinner Aisle~
Freezers line the aisle, jammed with every sort of frozen food possible.
You glance at the expiration date on a pot pie dinner and....oh my.....
that could explain the terrible stench. When the FROZEN food is rotting,
it means you need to reevaluate your choice of supermarkets.

The Adult Movies Room~
A very naughty place. The walls are covered with very naughty videos
indeed. You examine a fine piece of cinematography called 'Erectnophobia'
only to find out that it's rented. Darn. You begin to feel a little 
nervous as you glance around you; the people here are very disconcerting.
