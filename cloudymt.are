vain and very dangerous.

This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's
Monstrous Manual, copyright 1993, TSR, Inc.

   You gasp as you realize that the city was not close but rather far away.  
You were mistaken by the shear size of the city walls.  The city is not very
large for a dragon, but from your perspective it is huge and the walls are
unscaleable.

Before the City of Cloudy Mountain~
   In this are many dragons and half-dragons.  Under normal circumstances,
dragons tend to live in solitary environments, but due to disappearing 
territories, many have gathered in this city.  Some have also have taken 
spouses from other races, creating new half-races.  Although legally these
half-dragons are to be treated equal, most of the high ranking officials and
officers are pure dragon.

winged army as well, this battalion is nearly unstoppable.

  The north end of the court doesn't seem as busy, but the number of guards is
at least the same, if not more.  To the north is the King's palace, and a road
follows the north wall east.  The court is south and west.

know for sure how the queen died, but it is generally thought to be foul play.
Although the marriage was widely celebrated publicly, many of the pure dragon
nobles were against the marriage.  It has been rumored that Drakknar committed
this ghastly act, but those who know him well do not believe this.

The Dracolich's Lair~
   The room is black and a blue flame roars in the center of the cave.  The
smell of death nearly over powers you.  You gasp in terror as you see skulls
from adventurers that have come before you.

yet the room feels chilly.  There are some plants in the window, but they 
appear to be dead.  Scourge is sitting in a black and red chair, he grins
