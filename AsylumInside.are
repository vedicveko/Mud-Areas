Off in the corner, another pile of lumber has been stacked.

The Secretary's Room~
A very old and rotten wooden desk has been left here, apparently abandoned by
it's original owner. A few piles of lumber have recently been placed to one
side, apparently to rework the desk into A suitable work area.

fresh.

The Entryway~
Dark shadows veil deeper darkness, as you catch a glimpse of eyes peering
at you.  While this building seems to have been forgotten, recent construction
seems to have been performed. It appears as if the Asylum is back in business.

A Marble Arch~
Your footsteps echo loudly down a long hallway as you step through the arch
Many doors can be seen to the east and west, each appearing unused for quite
some time.
 
Layers upon layers of dust cover the marble of the floor here, disturbed only by tracks of human footsteps, and something....else.

tracks~
You can tell that several humanoids have traversed these hallways in the
recent past.  You also wonder what sort of creature would leave a large set of
3-toed paw marks, every 10 feet or so.  Either something VERY large, or
something with an unusual method of walking.

A Hallway~
The marble is ancient and cracked in several places. The wooden frame of the
doors around you is mostly rotted, and apparently covered with a dark
substance in several places.

passage~
I've hidden this note in the hopes that The Adminstrator will never find it, but that someone not a part of this evil Asylum may.  BEWARE!!!! 
The staff of this nightmarish institution are not what they seem. I dream of strange things at night:  Nurses with frog eyes, Therapists with slimy skin, and evil experiements gone insane in the bowels of this evil structure.  The Administrator MUST be stopped!

The Asylum surgery seems to be the most complete portion of the
Institution's remodelling.  Cots are organized into rows, medical items of all
sorts are lined neatly on tables. Apparently, the heart of The Administrator's
Project has something to do with medical research.
