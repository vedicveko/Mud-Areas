Looney is probably the oldest elf you have ever seen, at least 3000 years
old.  It is said that he was on Dragon's Haven even before the coming of
Searall.  Watching Looney for a bit, you realize he is *always* wiping the
same glass, and he serves his customers out of dirty glasses.  Better use
your own.

Trees shadow the ramshackle building, and to the west of the building, past

A room in the inn~
This room has a straw bed that looks like it *could* be comfortable after a
long journey on the road. It also looks occupied - clothing is hanging on a
small bar at the back of the room.

The end of the hallway.~

rooms this inn offers for rent as well as the staircase down. To the west is
a door marked "Looney's Room". There is a {Rsign{w on the door with a
{Rwarning{w in big red letters.

Inside Looney's Room~
When you enter the room, you realize that Looney has definitely earned
his name. This room does not even appear to be level - it is angled sharply
to the left. The light is annoyingly flashing between purple and red, and the
strong smell of incense is on the air.

Behind the boulders covering the entrance to the mine~
This is a small room behind the boulders. It appears that there are yet more
boulders covering the entrance beyond here, and you can go no farther.
