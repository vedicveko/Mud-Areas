Head Mages of East and West Amity, It is your duty to keep the forces of 
good on the East and evil on the west at war with one another, since you 
have sold out to Michus in exchange for greater power.  Make sure also that 
the way to Michus' palace is not found out.  Thus, guard the busy 
connection where day meets night and the watery vermin-infested area.  
There are trees at these places that are portals to us and to Sidhonia.
There is a secret password you have to know to enter them and Odilon knows
what it is.  May chaotic neutrality live on in you!
  
                                       Prince Michus' knight, Forni 
                                       Prince Michus' baron, Cation

Head clerics of E.  And W.  Amity, in exchange for the powers we who lead
for Michus gave you, you must make sure that east and west Amity stays
divided.  We will give 2 of you a key to hold that leads to our 
command center.  Guard these keys with your life, if either of the centers
in the east or west falls, we will be weakened and you'd be dead so, be
careful, no one must find the area with the broken doors or the area 
that is dusty yet regenerative.  We will be at one of these centers.
 
                            Tirsch and Conunum, Michus' squires

Mages and Warriors of Amity, as you know, Michus has taken over Amity and
has his forces, including you, making sure that West Amity becomes and stays
evil while East Amity stays good.  Michus worships Klutia, the goddess of
neutrality, but Michus has recently added Drophur, one of the 
gods of chaos, to his pantheon.  Thus, in his duty to his god and goddess,
he has gained contol over Amity and is making the west fight with the east,
bringing chaos to both sides under the rule of neutral Oread Nymphs, over
whom Michus rules.  To keep the powers we have bestowed upon you as Michus'
vassals, protect the Oread craftesmen who knows the way to me.
If I fall, so too will you when my superiors find out that you
have shirked your duties.
 
                                        Forn's vassal, Florius

Odilon, protect the key to our base with your life.  I will be either at
the base near the holes and bodyparts or the base near the training center
where praying can often be heard.

PS.  If you need something from our leaders, don't forget to
find the paper for clues to find the portal that takes you to 
where they are and do not forget the password chaotic neutrality.

{Cwater{r filled tub.  Beneath the tub there is a tiny coal burning furnace

heat the room, making it nice and confortable.  The red{R glow{r coming
from the coals provides the room with a nice ambiance.  To the west you
see a huge yellow{Y waterbed{r being warmed by another tiny furnace below
it.  The wall to the north is dominated by a bright, blue, stained glass{B
