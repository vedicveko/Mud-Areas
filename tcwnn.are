The Temple of Anon~
You are standing before the Temple of Anon- a truly majestic structure
constructed from pure marble. Tall Corinthian columns flank an impressive
set of bronze-bound oaken portals, which are never shut save in times of
trouble. Through these doors you can glimpse the majestic interior of the
Temple. Atop the pillars rests a plinth bearing an incredibly well-crafted
frieze which depicts the Immortals of AnonyMud at work creating the World.
To the left of the Temple there is a smaller, but by no means less exquisite,
structure, which has a single arch on the second floor, accessible by a set
of ornate marble steps which lead up from near where you are standing. It is
labelled as The "College of Anon". Another set of steps leads downward
into Anon's famed Chamber of Donations. A broad, tree-lined avenue called
"Victory Parade" runs past the Temple.

The Interior of the Temple~
Marvelously sculpted likenesses of the Immortals of AnonyMud line the aisle
of this sanctuary of the Gods. Tapestries on the walls depict their victories
over their enemies, and many of the treasures they acquired on such campaigns
are also displayed here. There is a magnificent altar fashioned of purest
obsidian to the north, chased with gold and partially covered with white
cloth. Behind this stands the healer, who will tell you how he can help you
if you look at him.

The Chamber of Donations~
In these rooms all the unwanted items donated by your fellow adventurers
accumulate. There are shelves, bins, chests and cupboards all filled with
various articles of equipment. Anyone is free to come here and take what
they will, but the Immortals frown on greedy characters who take it all,
or profiteers who take it and sell it. Both offenses result in SEVERE
punishment. There is a small sign here.

The Grocery Store~
You have entered a quaint Grocery Store, the shelves of which are lined with
basic goods of every type. Backpacks, water skins, ropes, lanterns, torches
and pouches are what the Grocer specialises in, though, and if you need any
of those goods, you've come to the right place. If you don't know how to
negotiate a transaction, simply look at the grocer.

The delicious aroma you smelt outside pervades this entire store. Cakes,

counter. Also behind the counter is a very mean-looking tattooed Dwarf with
missing teeth and fingers, but with a talent for baking unsurpassed in the
entire nation. If you don't know what to do next, try looking at the Dwarf
(if you dare...).

it? You see a portly Italian standing behind a large glass counter full of
fried food. It certainly smells a lot better than it looks. A customer
standing next to you says- "It looks a lot better than it tastes...". Most
of the food has probably been sitting under those hot lights for a couple
of hours. The only thing you can be reasonably sure of is the chips.
By the way, EVERYTHING is fried.
