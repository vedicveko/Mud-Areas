ANGRY. Its entire surface is made up of bits of metal, stone and fur. It's
face is only recognisable as such because of the big hole it uses as its
mouth and its two small red eyes. It may have been human once, but now it
seems that some magic has transformed it into a fearsome beast.

A bend in the passage~
        You reach another bend in the passage and realise that you can see
without the use of your light source. The roar that you have been hearing is
almost deafening here and it seems to be coming from the north. The light also
seems stronger towards the north. The air is damp and smells of decaying
vegetation.

The rainbow chamber~
        A huge cavern opens around you. You notice that you are standing on a
narrow ledge on the south side of the cavern. The sides of the cavern are
covered in moss which gives off a greenish light. A magnificent waterfall
sprouts from the west wall and falls down into the darkness where it smashes
against the rocks. You can see no way to continue in any direction but back
the way you came.

the north is completely blocked but for a small opening. The rocks, however
don't seem too stable. You can either proceed north through the hole or
along the safer passage to the south.

Centre of the great hall~
        You stand in the very centre of the hall. You can proceed in all four
compass directions. You see a small golden plaque imbedded in the ground at
your feet.

The east end of the great hall~
        Darathorn's great throne stands here made of solid gold. It is a pity
that, because of its weight, you will never be able to carry it away. The hall
continues to the north, south and west. To the east you see a heavy curtain.

The northeast corner of the great hall~
        This corner of the hall seems darker and colder then the rest of the

A small room~
        You have entered a small room behind the throne. It is plain and bare
and looks very stark after the golden great hall. There are three exits out of
the room. The first is west back to the hall. The second is through a small
door to the south, and the third is up through a hole in the ceiling.

The outer chamber~
        This is Darathorn's outer chamber and study. Most of his vilianous
business is conducted from here. Only his most trusted men are allowed in
here. The chamber is very functional. No frills or decorations can be seen.
Darathorn likes to keep business and pleasure seperate. A large oak door is
to the north.

Darathorn's bedroom~
        You are in Darathorn's bedroom. It is big and everything in it is big.
The bed looks as if it could comfortably hold 5 people. A large mirror on the
east wall and an over-stuffed armchair are the only other things in the
room.

NO more ladder~
        AAAAHHHHH!!!!! where is that ladder. The ladder has been devoured by
the mist. Since the ladder is no longer there, there is nothing preventing
you from falling. And so you do fall... a long long way. You eventually hit
the bottom, bounce twice and that is that.

A CRUSHING experiance~
        OOPS!!! As you move back through the hole you bump the unstable rocks
and the last thought on your mind, as thousands of tonnes of rock fall on top
of you, is: "Boy, was that a STUPID thing to do".
