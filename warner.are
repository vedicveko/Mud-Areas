Daffy Duck~
Daffy Duck splutters, "You're despicable!"

Porky Pig~
Porky Pig says "A-biya-biya-biya-That's All Folks!"

What a quaint little pig. So neatly dressed too. He seems to be quite well-
mannered and even tempered, but in this world anything could happen to make
him suddenly blow a fuse. Did you notice that he isn't wearing any pants?

Elmer Fudd says "Be vewy vewy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits!"

boots. But you get the feeling that he won't have a very successful hunt.

real danger of being eaten.

Entrance to Looney Tunes Land~
You are heading along a small path lined with white stones toward a grassy
field. This field seems to extend in all directions as far as you can see.
It looks strangely two-dimensional. You hear the strains of "The Merry-Go-
Round broke down" playing somewhere...

There is a small sign here.

A Grassy Field~
You are walking across a wide, grassy field. To the north you imagine you
can see a farmhouse, while a large stadium looms in the distance to the
south. To the west a dark and thick forest starts abruptly.

stadium. However, there is a small hole in the ground near an old oak

A Thick Forest~
This forest is rather forbidding, though some of its impact is lessened by
the fact that it feels as if you are walking past sheets of paper with
drawings of trees on them. No matter which way you walk, the trees converge
to one side of you, never in front, or behind, or around you. You can't seem
to get amongst them. There are posters stuck on some of the trees.

The Farmyard~

remaining unnaturally motionless. Come to think of it, you haven't seen
ANYTHING move here.

Outside the Farmhouse~
You are standing outside the red farmhouse you saw earlier. It is your
typical farmhouse on your typical farm, if farms were two-dimensional
cartoons.

Inside the Farmhouse~
You have entered the main room of the farmhouse, and true to its cartoon
unreality, it is the ONLY room in the farmhouse. You can't really take
anything, because it is all drawn on the walls.

Inside the Coop~
You are standing inside a handsome coop, lined with shelves with little

sitting in a row, laying away.

Further Inside the Forest~
This forest is rather forbidding, though some of its impact is lessened by
the fact that it feels as if you are walking past sheets of paper with
drawings of trees on them. No matter which way you walk, the trees converge
to one side of you, never in front, or behind, or around you. You can't seem
to get amongst them. There are posters stuck on some of the trees.

There is a hole in the ground here.

Inside a Rabbit Warren~
You are in a long narrow underground passage, obviously the home of some
rabbit, though it is unlike any rabbit warren that you have ever seen
before. Deckchairs, beach towels and several pairs of sunglasses lie stacked
next to old Billie Holliday 78s and a pile of old newspapers. There is also
a heap of Dodgers memorabilia, from the time when they were in Brooklyn.

In the City~
You have entered the city, and you quickly avoid several two-dimensional
cars that suddenly rush past, driven by faceless people with strange voices.
You may head north from here toward an apartment building, or south and
east out of town toward the desert and a forest respectively. To the west
lies a park.

Granny's Apartment~
Granny lives here with Tweety Pie, her beloved avian friend. His cage hangs
near the window. Outside, you can see the top of the telephone pole you
saw earlier; it is about the same height as this apartment. A rather odd
cat appears to be doing something whilst perched atop it. Wonder what he's
up to...? You can head across a tightrope wire he has affixed to here if
you want.

to a window of the apartment block. Through the window you can see a bird
cage. If you want, you can try and head across the wire, though there is
a yard full of savage dogs down below...
