Snorri~
Snorri is here, mixing up a new brew.

Snorri Sturluson is a short, elderly man, with a longish grey beard.  You 
can tell he has let his beard fall into the pot more than once because of 
the purple liquid covering it.  He grumbles to himself as he stirs his pot, 
looking up at you once in a while to see if you've made up your mind yet.
