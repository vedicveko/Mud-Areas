0 Kendermore~
Welcome to Kendermore! This is a li'l town I threw together around a pub ;)
The town is based on the Kender of Krynn (Dragonlance fame), and on the
Kender history and ideology as espoused in Anonymud, the mud this area was
originally written for.

kender scout~
a kender scout~
A kender scout patrols for enemies.
~
Kender scouts are respected by the whole community for their role in
detecting potential threats to their village. They are rather serious by
Kender standards, as recent attacks have made them constantly alert for
any invaders. They thus glare at you VERY suspiciously.

a kender warrior~
A kender warrior swaggers past you, chased by a flock of young girls.
~
Kender warriors as a scary lot, scary in the way that it's scary to trust
nuclear weapons in the hands of people with the minds of eight year olds-
WAIT! We do that anyway! Ah well... Kender warriors, indeed all Kender, are
most feared (to them, other races consider it avoiding) for their taunt
ability, with which they can stoke the temper of the most placid of foes into
a raging fury.

a drink and a chat. What a splendid fellow! You find yourself suddenly
reaching for your wallet. You could have SWORN you had it in your back
pocket...

The Path Leading to Kendermore~
You are skipping along a narrow trail lined with white stones toward a small
village in a light wood. From here, all you can see is the wooden barricade
surrounding the hamlet, and the smoke of many fires coming from the chimneys
of the houses. There is, of course, a sign here.

The Path Leading to Kendermore~
You are skipping along a narrow trail lined with white stones toward a small
village in a light wood. From here, you think you can see signs of activity
in the wood, which is directly to the east of hear. Listening carefully, you
hear grunts and squeals, followed by triumphant cries.

Out of the Woods~
You emerge once more onto a narrow, stone-lined path. The gates of the kender
village are directly before you. From here you can peer down the main street
of the village. You see elderly kender seated upon porches watching their
grandchildren play, while older kender youths stride about with their hoopaks,
showing off to a group of giggling kender schoolgirls.

A Private Residence~
You have entered the home of some kender family. Not surprisingly it is
crammed full of useless junk that the family has "acquired" over the years,
then cast aside in boredom a few days later. Other than that the home looks
quite comfortable.

The Village Square~
Here, the kender gather for meetings, festivals, markets and general
entertainment. There is always something happening here. You gaze admiringly
at the neatly pruned hedges that line the stone floored area, and at the
intricately carved fountain that sits in the center of the square (a "gift"
from the elves; doubtless the elves didn't give it consciously).

The Healer's Lodge~
Here the kender cleric heals the injuries of his god's flock as well as any
ailments visitors such as yourself may have. He stands behind a carved stone
altar, grinning impishly (kender are NEVER truly serious) at you.

Kender Barracks~
Here the standing militia of the village reside. This militia constitutes all
able bodied males over the age of majority for one year of their lives. The
presence of such a force is necessitated by the constant raids by hobgoblins
and goblins recently.

from passing merchant caravans. Evidently the militia don't take their job
too seriously, but then again when has a kender ever been known to take
things seriously...?

The Grande Pub~
At last! The place you were searching for all along (well, if you weren't,
you are now ;P). This magnificent pub is over 500 years old. Fashioned from
the finest cedar, its shining floors, massive benches, long, stein-covered
bars and intricately-carved stools make you just want to drink yourself to
death. You elbow your way through the crowd that always fills this pub, and
have a good look around. Tapestries adorn the walls, as do massive portraits
of kender of bygone years. A huge iron chandelier hangs from the massive
crossbeams that support the 20' high roof, and you estimate that at least
500 candles are currently burning in it.

floors~
These polished wooden floors have been painstakingly waxed every morning for
centuries now, and they look as new as they did the day they were laid.
~
E
benches~
Long, polished wooden benches line the walls, serving as support for the
food and drink (and usually inebriated bodies) of the many patrons here.
~
E
bar bars~
There are several bars in this place, all crowded with drunk patrons, though
the main bar lies further in, near the central hall.
~
E
stools~
These stools were hand-carved by Thessala the patient nearly 200 years ago
to replace the original stools, which were lost in the Great Brawl of '96.
~

tapestries portraits~
These depict many famous kender, as well as scenes of nature and village life.
The tapestries are all quite rustic and atypical for kender, and you surmise
that they were "borrowed" from some poor hobbit community.
~
E
chandelier~
This iron behemoth originally hung in the hall of Lord Garrison, commander of
the Human armies at the Battle of the Blood Plains, but he "gave it to the
kender as a reward for their services in the war" (it was actually to make
them bugger off).

The Central Hall~
Dozens of patrons gather here day in and day out to drink, sing loud songs
and swap tall stories. You see denizens of practically every known race (and
a few unknown) standing arm in arm singing "Auld Lang Syne", or challenging
each other to arm wrestles, games of darts or cards, or drinking contests.
A HUGE bar lies to the north of here, staffed by a very busy bartender.

The Bar~
The main bar of the pub lies here. It is at least forty feet long, perhaps
more, and though it is only 3 feet high (on account of the little folk), it
is still impressive. A burly kender is busy serving drinks, and though he
is being practically run off his feet, he still manages to find time for
a quick chat with every patron. Such is the way of the Grande Pub.

The Dance Hall~
In this part of the Pub, the Kender and their guests gather for dances,
accompanied by a 7 piece band seated upon a dais in the corner of this huge
room. It is currently deserted, but when the moment is right, it will be
flooded with inebriated customers enthusiastically throwing each other about
to the tune of kender and dwarven reels, or swaying softly to the
accompaniment of an elven waltz. An elegantly carved staircase winds its
way up to the next level in another corner here.
