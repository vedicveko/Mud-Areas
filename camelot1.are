You have entered into a full-blown party.  Men stand around drinking and
laughing.  The occasional toast to to the king is raised, and more often a
toast to the new queen.  Everyone seems in very good spirits, and the wine
flows freely.  You are hailed over and handed a glass of wine 'for luck'.

You follow the hall around the curve, and glance around.  The rose arbors
trail off here, though the lattices are still present.  Of course, Camelot
was just built two years ago, so the roses probably have not had time to
cover the walls, yet.  The flagstones are not as smooth here, having been
pitted and worn by footsteps, and the scents in the air are of sweat and
rusty metal.

fire sizzles quietly in the center, and occasional sparks fly up into the

full of rich clothing, obviously for use by the good priest when he's not on

The kitchen is a madhouse of activity, due to the wedding festivities
that are taking place.  Servants are running madly about, organizing
platters, filling flagons with mead, wine, beer and water, and carrying food
out and empty plates in.  There are cats weaving in and out of the tables
and legs, snatching bites of food whereever they can find them.

Kitchen~
The kitchen here is dedicated to several large tables, filled with food
and serving utensils.  Servants line the table, chopping and preparing
dishes, and two large fireplaces host huge joints of roasting meat.  The
floor is slippery here with grease and other food particles and footing is
hazardous.

Armor lines the walls of this corridor, some of it dating back to the first
Roman conquerers of Britain.  The floor is polished smooth, but you can see
the marks of many boots that have passed over it in the last few hours.  To

Throne Room~
You enter into the throne room off Camelot and stare around you in awe. 
Everywhere, lamplight shines of the mellowness of gold trimming and jeweled
fittings.  The white marble floor has been buffed to an incredibly high
shine, and the walls are hidden behind the rich hangings from all around the
world.  King Arthur, and his new Queen, Guenhuevere, sit on their golden
thrones, watching over the festivities of the wedding feast.

The castle is only part of the world.  So much lies in the great

You emerge from the sound and light into the relative calm of Queen's

This room contains a small table, laid with servings for two.  Obviously
it is intended to give the King and Queen a private dinner before they
retire to their bedchambers.  The settings on the table are of silver and

along it's edge.  The king's chair is obvious by its golden trimmings, and
the Siege Perilous also, by the roped off area around it.  The floor has
been brightly polished, and the walls are scrubbed to a shine.
