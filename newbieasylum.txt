This zone has the only 'modern' references of mobs or objects in the
entire world of Dibrova. It was allowed only because it was a newbie
zone - the Dibrova newbie area is mostly comprised of 'fun' areas
rather the serious ones that are part of the main world. Patients
wander the halls drooling on themselves while doctor sip from flasks
of whiskey. Upper and lower levels contain testing areas and holding
cells for some very well-known felons.
