*Windmill
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This is a windmill set in the middle of a grasslands area, also available for
download, which has a underground area which house the Militant Order of the
Sword (the MoS), a militant organization dedicated to the eradication of
the Elven race.

There is a small quest built into this zone in conjunction with the Elven
zone.  The MoS stole the Lore Tapestry from the elves which depicts their
race's history and magic from the beginning of time.  When this Tapestry
is given to Reklan, an elf in the Elven zone, a player is rewarded.  The
Elven zone is not available for download on this page, however it can be
downloaded on the CircleMud site, without Reklan - he was added by Dibrova
after the download. If you would like a copy of the zone as we use it, please
contact Kaan via mudmail or email and request it.
