The glyphs are drawn upon the stone with what appears to be blood.

The torches are made of a black wood, and as you draw nearer, you find
that they do not emit any heat.  Indeed, they seem to be radiating cold.  The

them.

As you lean forward and look in the pool, you see nothing but the dark
murky water.  Gradually though, an image forms before you.  You recognize the
person the image shows.  It is the Avatar!  Apparently this is a pool that
Ciquala uses to scry upon her enemies. The image is so clear, you almost
believe you could step into the pool, and appear in Lord British's castle.

Holding Cell~
This is nothing more than a small room with a very heavy iron door
closing it off from the laboratory.  This is where Ciquala's minions keep
the experiments they are working on.

Guard room~
The occupants of this room were obviously left here by the Lich to
keep intruders like you from bothering her, or learning her plans.  There
are doors to both the east and west.

A seemingly empty tunnel~
This empty tunnel has doors leading in all directions.  The roof of
the tunnel seems abnormally low and shiny, almost as if it is not dirt.  This
room is also as cold as all the others were.

The Map Room~
This room is filled with maps, apparently containing some of Ciquala's
plans.  You notice many maps of Lord British's castle.  You might be able to
gain some information on Ciquala's plans, as well as learn your way through
British's castle if you examine the map more closely.

map~
As you reach for a map to examine it closer, it bursts into ice cold flames and
disintegrates before your eyes.  Apparently Ciquala has taken precautions
against people snooping in her Lair.

Storage Room~
You see many boxes before you, apparently this is a storage room of
some sort.  You can bet that whatever a lich is storing, that it can't be good
for the world in general.

You see a grate on the floor.  When you look down it, you see several
creatures below, humanoid, but you can't make out exactly what they are.
There are also doors leading all directions but west.

The Room of the Automatons~
You gasp as you realize that these pasty faced people do not seem to
have a will of their own.  No doubt the work of the Lich.  If these
monstrosities are allowed to escape into the world, they will cause no end
of problems for Midgaard.

Torture Chamber~
This room is fitted with many instruments and tools designed to cause
pain and fear in anyone who enters.  However, you don't pay as much attention
to the racks and iron maidens as you would if were not for the lich in the
room.

Entrance to Ciquala's Throne Room~
This does not look like any of the other rooms you have been in up till
now.  The ceiling rises a full 40 feet in the air above you.  The walls are
covered with murals proclaiming the might and majesty of Ciquala.  She does
not look old and decayed as you would have pictured her.  Instead, she looks
rather regal and stately, but undoubtedly evil.

Ciquala's Throne Room~
This room is clothed in darkness, and a chill eminates from the foul
monarch of the undead.  A large tapestry hangs behind her throne.  The
ceiling rises above you, hidden in the darkness beyond the range your
light can penetrate.  A feeling of hopelessness and insignificance overwhelms
you as you face the Lich, Ciquala!

Treasure Chamber of Ciquala~
This room contains enough wealth to fund an army, perhaps a small
kingdom.  Racks or weapons, and spellbooks, and potions, not to mention large
piles of coins that cover the floor.  A large paving stone in this room seems
slightly disturbed.
