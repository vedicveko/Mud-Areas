#HELPS
Merith's Parlor is where young adventurers come to gain knowledge and
share experiences with others.  Tis said that Merith makes some of the
best food in the realms.

Merith's Parlor was written by Alecca for Devil's Silence MUD
(ds.ruinsmud.com:5000).  It is being used with the understanding
that the area will remain relatively intact and that the help file shall
not change, only changes to hp/weapon dice/armor class and the like are
allowed.  Names and descriptions will not change.

Farle~
Farle~
Farle the soldier stands and watches quietly.
~
Farle is a dark-haired, blue-eyed man with an extremely
grave expression drawn upon his face.  He wears a bright blue
set of overalls, with some protective layers of leather overtop
and a white cloak to round it out.  His crossbow looks well-used
and cared for.  You think he knows how to use it.

Karlea sneers at you rudely, and ignores you.  He looks
rather non-descript and plain, just an ordinary man taking
a break. His knives do not look ordinary at all, however.

Outside the Parlor~
You are outside a large, two-story building which proports
to be 'Merith's Parlor' on a brightly lettered sign out 
front.  You hear laughing and revelry from inside, sounds 
like a lively place.  The main doors are directly south of 
you, and small paths lead east and west around the building. 
Eastward is another smaller building, obviously a stable.  
Northward is the main road, providing all the traffic and 
customers for this establishment.

Near a Large Building~
You are north-west of the Parlor.  This section of the 
path seems less used, possibly because there's nothing really
over here.  The trees crowd in towards the clearing, making 
the general area seem rather eerie somehow.  The voices 
coming from inside are clearly audible, and by listening hard
you can almost make out the words. The path around the building 
continues to the west and south.

where the kitchen entrance is.  A well trodden path leads 
east, towards a small shack that is unmistakeably an outhouse.
You hear the unmistakeable sound of clanging pots and pans 
from the inside, the warning of an upcoming meal.  The path

Inside the Stable~
You are standing inside the dusty confines of the stable. 
Stalls line the aisle, some with horses, some empty.  A pail 
filled with water and a stack of grain are heaped up against the interior wall, dimly illuminated by a lantern hanging from a rafter.  Seems rather quiet in here...

Main Room~
The bar runs south here all along the western wall.   A 
few smaller tables here are set up with various board games, 
ready to play.  There's also a shelf along the wall, lined 
with a few popular books; light reading all of them.  The 
patrons here seem to be a bit quieter than the rowdy bunch 
in the rest of the building.

Main Room~
A window here offers a view outside, where it doesn't seem
near as social as it is inside.   Tables filled with laughing
customers eat and drink and generally be merry, not caring 
what the weather is like, and probably not even knowing.  
There's a general sense of joy in the room; the joy of still 
being alive in such a dangerous world as this one.

Main Room~
You stand just inside the Main Room of Merith's Parlor. 
The whole place stretches out all around you, a 
conglomeration of people, food, and alcohol.  The sheer 
chatter and roar of conversation makes your ears hurt a 
little, and then you suddenly notice you're smiling.  Yes, 
this place might do for awhile...

The giant fireplace here sends a great amount of heat 
throughout the room.  The sheer massiveness of the stone 
edifice and the literal bonfire inside makes you give the 
area a clear way.  A few of the older and less human 
residents of the inn seem to be enjoying these tables, 
however.

Several dart boards line the wall to the south, and darts

carefully walk by the wall to avoid being pin-cushioned 
involuntarily, and you think it would be a good idea to do 
the same.

The tables seem to thin out around here, to give room for 
the traffic going in and out of the kitchen through the 
archway to the south.  Waiters and waitresses march in and 
out with empty plates and sumptuous platters, hardly stopping
to breathe in their business.  You hear the distant clank of 
a pot banging against something, the chefs are busy too it 
seems.

This seems to be a central part of the room, where many

The wooden bar runs along the length of the western wall,

from this vantage point, and guess that this establishment is
turning a pretty penny in profits.

The bar continues along the length of the western wall.  
An empty bottle with some spare coppers in it lies on top of 
its polished surface; tip collection evidently.  The tables 
nearby seem mostly filled with people and food, the bar 
appears at times to be either packed, or merely elbow-to-
elbow.  A lantern hanging from a rafter overhead casts 
shadows among the beerstains on the floor and gives the 
complexion of everyone around a sort of glow.

Main Room~
In the clutter of the main room of the Parlor, is a path
leading out from the kitchen to the east.  A wide archway
allows admittance to the back room, from which you hear the 
distant clank of a pan hitting another.  There aren't very 
many tables here, due to the amount of traffic coming in and 
out.

Kitchen~
This is the main entranceway of the kitchen.  Two archways
serve as an entry and exit point from the main room of the 
Parlor, one north, one west.  The kitchen is a room roughly
thirty feet by thirty feet, extending from the south and east
from here.  You see many pots on the stove bubbling away and 
hear the whistle of a kettle somewhere off to the left, 
business must be good.

Kitchen~
You are standing in a more quiet area of the kitchen, 
where various supplies of flour, grain and meats are kept.  
The kitchen extends south and west from here; that's where 
the main clutter seems to be.  A steady clanging
from the north wall reminds you that the main room is where 
are the fun and action seems to be.

Kitchen~
The south-eastern section of the kitchen here is a 
veritable whirlwind of activity!  The entire area is 
comprised of cooking surfaces and ovens; enough to keep a 
massive amount of food ready at any one time.  The aisles
are large, allowing room for frantic chefs and waiters to 
hurtle through the kitchen with only a small amount of 
collisions.  Seems hectic, yet efficient.  The rest of the 
kitchen is to the north and west from here.

Kitchen~
This is the back entranceway to the kitchen, where the 
door is kept seasonally open to allow the hot air to escape. 
Some trash is piled up near the door, waiting to be taken 
out.  The main area of the kitchen extends to the north and 
east from here, a hodge-podge of business and insanity in 
motion.  Looking at the general cleanliness, however, you 
think this would be a good place to eat.

Um.  Whew! It's definitely an outhouse...doesn't smell too good at 
all.  There's a wooden plank with a few 'convenient' holes cut in
it for service, and several curtains hung up for privacy.  A 
bowl with a large cake of soap next to it serve as sanitary 
measures.  Otherwise, there's not too much here to take
an interest in.
