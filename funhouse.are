sound of laughing and playing while the line continues moving on and on, until
you are all the way in front... Now... what were you doing here again? To the
north, you smell some REALLY delicious food.

here, as you can see children running through the funhouse to the north and
running out the exit, back to the entrance without a ticket.

the walls. Clowns frown and stare at you and others laugh and grin evilly
at you with their eerie smiles. Images of melting clocks and surreality in
its fullest fill your mind and confuse your sense of direction.

of the cylinder, and you get dizzy and fall.

OH NO! You seem to be lost in a huge maze of identical mirrors.
Every time you think that you have found the exit, you walk into a mirror

Along the Hallway~
You keep walking along the hallway, wondering when it will end... There are
thousands of doors on either side of you. You try one. Ooops... not a real
door... You hurt your hand on a cheap painting. You try a few more. Empty
rooms... You try a couple more... all locked or rusted shut. You wonder if
there ARE any doors that you can enter.

Zero-G Room~
As you enter this room, you fel weightless and soon float into the air
around you. You are drawn upwards, upwards, until you bang your head on
the ceiling. You find that you can move yourself around the room by using
a swimming-like motion.

The Rubber Room~
You walk in this room, only to be propelled against the far wall, and
bounced back and forth between walls. You continue to bounce, trying to
aim yourself towards the door to the west. You try and stop, but all efforts
to do so seem futile. You continue to bounce...

The Southern Hedge Maze~
You have entered the hegde maze's southern region. All you can see around
you is a mixture of different shrubberies and bushes. There is no way to get
through this thick layer of foliage, so the only way through is to find the
exit.

The Control Booth~
You enter a room with blinking lights and sounds. Strange machinery lines
every wall and knobs, buttons, and levers line the control panels of each
machine. You can now see from where all of the illusions and tricks from
the Fun House are created and controlled.

On a Steel Bridge~
You are walking along a narrow suspension bridge made of steel girders and
iron bolts. You wonder if you are actually still inside of a fun house, as
you look down and see a 2000 foot drop.

Nearing the End~
You think you are nearing the end as you can hear the clammering of the
crowds back in the circus. You can almost make out the big top back to the
south, and you can smell popcorn and cotton candy wafting through the swift,
cooling breeze.

The Concessions Stand~
You walk up to the concessions stand, the smell of all sorts of delicious
foods and drinks fills your nostrils and lifts you up to a self-contained
blissful haven of pleasure. You are SO tempted to buy something, but you
hope that it won't give you a stomach ache like last time.... OWWWW...
