The Entrance to the Public Dungeon.~
You are standing within the Public Dungeons of Midgaard.
This is where Midgaard's most feared criminals are brought and left to rot,
where all may come and look.  The whole dungeon is underground, and smells
like all underground places do.  Above you, you see the light of Market
Square, and to the south, further within the dungeon.
