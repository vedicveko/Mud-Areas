A winding roadway running through an open area of fields where many
serfs and slaves work. This is meant as a connector zone to eight
seperate Barons' realms who run the area. There is a small king's
castle in the center of this field area which is vacant. The plot
of the area is that the old king died and the eight barons vie against
each other for power of the throne.
