A Mountain cliff~
  The mountain path that seems to go on for miles and miles suddenly
disappears into the thin air. Before you is nothing but the open air.
Your feet accidentally knocks into a small rock and it falls down the
cliff. You look down, and jump in shock. Clouds flow effortlessly
beneath you. The mountain path has taken you higher than the clouds!
You look around, trying to pinpoint where you are. But all you see is
glorious sun shine, fluffy clouds and clear, crisp air. You stop for
a moment, absorbing the beauty of Nature and decide to turn back.
As you turn your head, you caught a glimpse of a Rainbow Bridge!
Impossible! Yet, there it is, a bridge in the hues of a rainbow shimmers
in the air, leading somewhere...

  As the bridge crescents down, you see a great Gate of Clouds before
you. The Gate, though clearly constructed of clouds, is stronger than
any gate you have seen before. You look beyond the Gate and your jaws
falls wide open in awe. In the distance, a city of solid, white marble
glimmers faintly. The white glory of the sun shine diffuses upon the
walls of this magnificent city, setting in ablaze like a sparkling
gem. The city must be an abode of perfect blessedness. As you open the
Gate of Clouds, a thought hit you. Who or what can possibly live in
such a nirvana?...

Steps to the City of Olympia~
  After a brief walk from the Gate of Clouds, you stand on the base of
the magnificent city. A series of white marble steps lies ahead of you.
It snakes gracefully upwards, leading you to the shimmering city that
beckons to you from above. To your side, you see two marble statues of
winged horses, wings out stretched and hoofs in a prance, as if in a
salute to you. As you rise your right foot to ascend the steps, you
look up and realize that your journey is far from over...

Entrance to the City of Olympia~
  With every ounce of strength left in your body, you order your feet
to rise and lower itself on the final step. The climb has tired your
body, and it cries out for a moment of rest. Two marble white columns
towers aside you, signifying the entrance of the City lies just behind
them. You lean against one of the columns and slowly sink into a
comfortable resting position. Although tired and weary from physical
exertion, you still marvel at the sheer radiance of this City.
You have traveled to many places and have seen many astounding sights,
but nothing in your memory could have matched a fraction of the beauty
that lies ahead of you.

The City of Olympia~
  As you explore this enchanting city, your worries and sorrow leaves
you. A deep sense of peacefulness enters your soul and you want nothing
more than to stay in this City for all eternity. The beauties of the
world you left behind, pales in comparison to Olympia. The palaces of
Kings and Lords that you once held as incomparable, seem like old
wooden sheds next to the glorious architectural buildings that soothes
your vision. Towering columns of white marble crafted by artists of
unparalleled skill line the paved silver roads, like eternal guardians.
As you glance around, you are blinded by a brilliance unmatched even by
the Sun. Slowly, your eyes adjusts to the blinding radiance and in
the midst of all this light, you catch a glimpse of a architectural
creation that puts its surrounding buildings to shame.

Before the Grand Palace~
  Silence. The music that had ensnared your soul in its sweet melodies
has suddenly stopped. You open your eyes and the sight that dominates
your vision astounds you. You do not even know how to begin to describe
the elegance of the structure that stands before you. Words holds no
meaning before this. Blinding white light radiate from this architectural
monument, enveloping the marble in a iridescent glow. Besides you, stands
two marble figures of winged goddesses in flight. So life like are the
statues that you could almost feel their breath sweetening the air. As
you glance upward, the pediment of this structure catches your eye.
Gods and Goddess of strength and beauty greets your eyes, each in a pose
of descending height. In the center of the pediment, you see the mighty
Cloud-Gather, Zeus, in all his divine glory. And to his sides, the other
eleven Olympian Gods and Goddess portrayed in their own eminence. Slowly,
you force your eyes away from the pediment and continue to marvel at
the other intricate craftsmanship of the palace.

before you, as your eyes travel with the intricate relieves that grace
your vision. Then, the same enchanting melody that had enslaved you in
its tunes once again dance seductively in the air. It calls to you,
beckoning you to lose yourself in its siren song. Slowly it draws you
up the steps, and through the golden doors that opened as you approached.

  The music flutters through the air like a delicate butterfly looking

on its melodious sound. You float on its transparent wings, not caring
where it leads you. So ensnared are you in its web that you never took
notice of the beauty of the Grand Hall. Light is the ceiling and the
tiles that composes the floor. Sheer light and mist tenderly caresses
you. Columns of light circles this vast openness while heavenly scents
of sweet blossoms perfumes the air. Yet, what is all of this compared
to the heavenly sound of Apollo's Lyre...

of mortals from all parts of the world play before your eyes, showing
you the loves, crimes, sins and innocence of mortals. Clouds bursting
with light cascades delicately around you, as you stand here, completely

  A cool sea breeze brushes against you as you step into this Hall. The

sound of oceanic waves dances in the air. Luscious marble sculptures of
Sea Nymphs tower over you, supporting a large blue dome. As you marvel
at the divine artistry of the dome, you realize that the dome is made
entirely of water! It ripples with the kisses of the cool sea breeze, as
a rain of radiant light casts hues of gold upon its blue surface. A pool
of deep blue lies before your feet. Tiny marble sculptures of leaping
dolphins and mermaids gracefully circles the pool. As you gaze into the
depths of the pool, a white cascading stair case snakes down into its
watery depths. What can possibly lies down there?!

The Hall of Erebus~
  Although the light of the heavens sets the hall ablaze in a glow, a
chilling sensation creeps slowly upon you. Like the rest of Olympia,
artworks beyond compare fills this Hall...yet, something dark and
sinister seems to undermine all the joys exquisite beauties that lies
here. You cannot shake off this sense of morbidness, it seems to
dominate your very soul, filling you with sadness and hopelessness.
A pit of pure darkness lies in the center of this gloomy Hall. Horrid
stone carvings of tormented souls and ghastly ghouls circles this
hellish pit. A deep overwhelming urge to hurl yourself into this
pit of sheer evil suddenly grabs hold you...But with every ounce of
energy in your body, you fight it off. It would not be wise to stay
in this corrupted Hall...

by titanic beams of sheer radiance. A gentle zephyr brushes tenderly
across your skin, gingerly bathing you in a soothing warmth. As you
glance into the far horizon, herds of winged horses of pure whiteness
gracefully takes flight into the glowing air. Melodious chirps of
song birds fills the air, while scents of heavenly blossoms perfumes
the air. The setting sun sends splashes of golden reds and oranges
across the sky, creating a cosmic work of art...

  Before your eyes lies a garden of pure impossibilities. Vegetations
that has vanished under the careless mortals blossoms here. Exotic
flowers from all over the world scents the air with their sweet
perfumes. Water of the purest nature cascades gracefully down a
exquisite marble sculpture of Gaea, bring life to the Garden. Tall oaks
and pines towers above you, shading you from the brilliance of the
sun. To the horizon, the peak of Olympus rises above a sea of clouds.
A luscious forest of greens waver softly under a soft breeze, as if
inviting you to play in its cool shades.

  The Hanging Gardens of Babylon could not match a fraction of the
beauties here. Orchids from afar bloom eternally here, forever
granting its exotic beauties to the Olympians. A large apple tree
bearing golden apples stand admist all this luscious vegetations.
It towers even above the Grand Palace, reaching the heavens with its
long, brownish limbs. As you near it, a faint voice calls out to you.
The voice is full of warmth and love, like a mother's lullaby to her
baby. It serenades you in its love, embracing you like a mother to
her sweet new born. Boundless love and compassion fills you, soothing
your less than peaceful soul. No one can give so much love, no one...
except for Gaea, the Mother to all things, the Mother of the World...

warmth of the Garden of Gaea, frost dominates the air. You pull your
cloak more securely around you, trying in vain to protect yourself from
the frost. The snow, becoming thicker and thicker as you near the
peak of Olympus, impedes your progress, determined to keep you from the

cave ahead. A warm glow tells you that there is fire there...As you

  As you enter this cave, hordes of metallic objects of the most
exquisite craftsmanship lies carelessly here, as if they were nothing
more than a heap of trash. You pick up a sword near by, and carefully
examine it. You test out some familiar battle moves and find that
this sword is beyond compare. No weapon smith in your knowledge could
produce such a fine piece of art. You swing it at a near by boulder
to test its sharpness, and to no surprise, it cuts through the solid
rock like knife to butter. Without any regard for art, you toss this
sword aside, thinking that there must be things of more beauty and
worth somewhere in this cave...

by Zeus for giving fire to mortals. Tiny bits of ice and frost cling
to his hair and beard, while the jagged peak of Olympus pierces his skin.
The snow around him, dyed by the blood of this Titan, is a deep bloody
crimson. He looks at you, begging you to release him from his eternal
suffering. Yet, what can a mere mortal do...

Blooming blossoms circle this small clearing by the pond. A soft moss
like bed of grass contrasts artistically with the colours of the roses
and other blossoms. The willow hangs like a canopy over this delicate
bed of grass, providing a comfortable shade.
