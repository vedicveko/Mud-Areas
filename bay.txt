Connector Zones: McGintey Cove Dock Area, Yllythad Sea

This is the bay made to connect McGintey Cove to the sea, so that our
star coder might better be able to get things rolling on the boat code
(love ya, Rodger;-). This zone is tailor made to fit into McGintey's
southern boundary, so it is not suggested that you use this zone all
by itself unless you want to do a lot of revamping.
