Small Lake~
This lake is small, and you can see a shore on all sides.
Somewhere to the south, you notice air bubbles hitting the
surface.  Perhaps you might want to examine that.

Air Bubbles~
It is truly a strange site to see here.  Air bubbles are
emergin from the water in an endless stream.  You notice a large
dark mass at the bottom of the clear water, but you can't make out
what it is.  Perhaps you should go investigate.

You hold your breath here, and the effort hurts your lungs after

lake, because the light doesn't reach that depth.

Sunken Ship~

that it could have sailed from nearby.

objects.

Still, if this ship was risen to the surface, it could act as a very

a fair day as they walk by, even though they have absolutely no idea

and so are not worried about what you might do, since they can easily
keep track of you.  There is a magic shop to the north.

Because of the nature of the cave-ins in this volcano, this
part of it is almost impossible to navigate, still if you're
carefull, you know you can probably make it through.

End of the Maze~
You've reached the end of the volcanic caverns, and you are sure glad of it.  Th
e eerie light of the fungus growing on the rocky walls gives way to the brillian
t glare of the sun here, and you can begin your ascent of the volcano.
