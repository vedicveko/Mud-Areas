A Dark Path Through The Forest~
You suddenly realize that the forest around you has changed drastically. 
The once bright day is now quite overcast and dull. A sharp wind suddenly 
picks up and brings a cool chill to your bones. All around you you hear the 
chilling sounds of the forest, almost like it was out of a story book. 
The dusty road continues north and south, winding around a curve up ahead, 
making the end of the road, or what it will bring to, impossible to see. 
A large sign is here, demanding your attention. (look sign)
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.

A Long Dusty Trail~
The path continues, and the view is still not as interesting. The sky has 
become more dark and it appears that the clouds are filled with rain. 
The faint smell of autumn; the rotting of leaves on the  moist forest floor, 
adds to the quaint scene. A rustle in the trees above you finally shows life 
in the dreary forests. The path turns and continues west,  and south back 
to the lighter forests.

Suddenly the path comes to an open section on the road. You realize that 
mountainous peaks stab sharply into the sky, creating a look of might, a look 
of power. Lush green plants can be found in all directions, speckled with the 
odd reds and yellows of the wild flowers. A small brook trickles alongside the
path, adding a harmonious tune with the soft whistle of the scarcely know Grey 
Bird. A soft mist whisps slowly past, cascading over the brook, creating 
a beautiful soft atmosphere. 
The path continues west and east.

A Steep Path Down-Hill~
The bright warm sunshine seems to lighten your heart, as you notice you 
have lost all sense of direction. The quaint small brook that followed you 
from the east, is slowly gaining speed. Mountains of all sizes tower up sky-
high above you, creating a wonderous view of the lands. The crisp cool air 
seems to add new strength to your sore old bones. The path continues west

Alongside A Wild Waterfall~
So much for a quaint little brook. The what once was small brook is now 
a raging waterfall, crashing and thumping against the rocks, as it visiously 
works its way, still of to the north of your path. You notice the mountains 
seems to encase you in a valley, forever growing taller and more mighty with 
every step. A dark green moss seems to cover the trees about you, camouflaging
the wild animals of the woods. It seems as though these trees and plants are 
older than time itself, yet have never aged a day. The ground is covered in 
soft brown pine neddles, matting you heavy footsteps. Several large boulders 
are scattered here and there throughout the woods. The path continues west and 
back east.

A Sharp Bend in the Road~
You come face to face with a mighty mountain wall, blocking your path. You 
feel like you have waisted all your time and effort just to get here, to find 
a dead end. Right before you give up you notice a flicker of movement to your 
right. You turn, yet you see nothing. Suddenly you realize a small matted path 
curves around the mountain, almost like a deer trail. Perhaps you should 
follow it to see where it takes you. The path continues north, through the 
deer trail, and east, where you came from.

You are on a windy deer trail, which seems to swirve thisway and that. 
The sounds of the forests are about you, weaving together in a harmonious tune,
with the wind in the trees as its melody. The soft mist on your face seems to 
wet your boots aswell, adding to the special touches of the woods. Annoying
little spider webs seem to stick to your face and clothes, making this trip 
very much unejoyable. Up ahead you see that the path widens. The path

Well, you were right. The wall of the mountain does jut out and block your 
path, but a quaint little bridge lies to the north, created by a human, or 
some other creature. It seems quite stable and safe to cross. A beautiful brook
trickles slowly underneath the small bridge, creating a relaxing sound. The
forest seems to be more lush on the other side of the brook. The path continues

gets your shoes wet. This sure is a nice spot. The trail continues north, off

trail. The peaceful sounds of the Blue Birds and the joyous chatter of the 
chickmunks add to the beauty of these lands. The tall Oak and Mapple are just 
some of the numerous trees you recognize. Beautifully lush ferns fill the gaps 
between trees; a little Red Juliefire sprouting out here and there, giving the 
forest floor a wider variety of color and beauty. In the distance you hear the 
rushing of a waterfall, and the loud soulfull cry of the Black Crane. The path

of the waterfall are getting louder and clearer. The sun plays shadow games 
with the wind through the trees, lightening your heart with joy. Deep in the 
bush you see a bright red Pinion bird, rare to all parts of the world save 
the most beautiful. The trees and plants seem to almost glow with peace.
This is such a beautiful place, you never wish to leave. A soft breeze lifts 
your hair and brings you the fresh scent of Golden Wildflowers, making you 
wish you were in a sunny field, rolling in them. But you still would much 
rather be here. The path continues west and east.

The Great Lookout~
You are standing about 300 feet above the raging rapids of The River of 
Venis. You realize that the trees did a great job consealing this massive 
cliff. Right beside you there is a massive rading waterfall that tumbles down 
at a gloryous speed. It is amazing how powerful these falls are. A well 
crafted bridge swings the span of the cliff, right in front of the waterfall.
You would hate to make a mistake and take a step off the bridge. The path

of what lies below, a 300, perhaps more, foot drop to your death. Still the 
white foam at the bottom looks as soft as clouds, and the speed of the falls 
brings a cool, freesh breeze. Just being this high up is so exhilerating, you 
could stay here for ever! The bridge continues south or back to the solid

The Druid Lord's Secret Study~
You have stumbled into the most beautiful room you have ever seen! giant 
slabs of white marble with the accasional greyish streak through them cover 
every bit of the floor, save for the far south of this room, which has 
a gloryious carpet, telling the tales of several great battles, all woven 
into the magical design. Tall book shelves cover the eastern wall of this 
cavern; books of lore, magic, spells, ceremonies and much more. A giant
oak desk lies infront of the bookshelves, covered with paper and all of 
Xavier's work. A light blue chair rests in the northern corner. A thin line 
of glass-like whater cascades down the western opening creating a magical 
window. Etched in stone high above this wonderous site are the words 
'Mirror of The Worlds'. You gaze into the light white waters and see your 
past. Despite being inside a dark cave, this study seems to be quite 
comfortable. Several bright torches line the walls, and one giant blue flame 
floats magically in the top-most center of the cave. Magic just seems to flow 
through this cave, magic beyond your wildest wonders. You wonder where the 
exits are.

Tulips and Rose bushes line the pathway, adding once again to the beauty of 
this strange land. The tall trees seem to give off the right amount of shade, 
to keep you from getting too hot in this sun. The path you are one is kind of 
like one you would have up to your house; big enough for one or two people,
long and curvy. The mountains loom even higher in the distance than they ever 
had before. You can tell that each step takes you down hill, into a vally of 
some sort. The land about you appears as though it was formed ages ago, due 
to earthquakes and storms. The path continues north to the bridge, or south

in a wonderous valley. It would be interesting to see what this place is

You are now walking on a stone walkway to a very fancy house. Nicely trimmed 
flowers and bushes lie in neatly tended patterns along the dark green grass 
at the fron of the house. The house itself is huge and white. It appears to be 
two stories high, and it looks to be as though this house belonged to a Lord
or a Lady, or someone with LOTS of money. You wonder who would live in such

doing business, heading in or our of the city, basically, keeping quite busy. 
The floor is covered in a light green carpet, rolled out endlessly along the 
floor. Crystal clear windows are along the side walls and several torches

like his job. You wonder if you should report this fellow, the choose not to. 
They may question about why you were in the cells, perhaps think you were 
trying to free one of those stinky...DROWS! The corridor has only one exit,

It seems as though the owner of the Pub managed to pursuade the queen into 
letting him use the top of the wall as a dinning lounge. Very few people are 
here but they do seem to be enjoying themselves. From this high up you can 
see the whole city with the monsterous castle towering above all the rest. 
You  notice that the city is on an island and right at the very bottom of 
the Valley. Beautiful green forests suround the outer walls, making it seem

A top of the city walls, a small portion of what the Pub owner owns is 
used as a dance floor. Though vacant, it looks to be like a wonderful floor. 
Soft music plays in the background and you have an urge to dance. Perhaps one 
day you should bring your special "someone" here and show them the city from 
one of the finest views. The only exit is west.

A Secret Passage Behind The Bookcase~
Upon lifting a great book on Titan lore, the bookcase opens infront of you, 
leading into a secret passage. You quickly scrambled in, with the bookcase 
closing shut behind you. Very dim torches light this stone corridor, making 
it almost impossible to see. It seems to be a dead end, or at least it needs 
a key to get back into the library. You wonder what mysterious things lie 
ahead, where does the path lead to, where shall you end up? The only exit is

west of the three-way passage, but you feel mighty tired for any surprizes 
or letdowns. Before you give up all hope, you notice a small little door near 
the ground. No, not a door but a grate leading out side! You beed down to get 
a closer look. *sniff* The smell! Garbage! It leads to the garbage dump! You 
wish there was another way but, 'Que sera, sera'...'whap happens, happens.'

thieves, mages and clerics all fight for their lives here, against the demons 
of hell, shadowspawn. You have a choice of south or west, both  leading to 
training grounds. You really do wish to leave here as fast as you may.

Inside The Palace~
You have entered the glorious and wonderful palace. The home of the King 
and Queen of the Titans! This palace seems to be made of pure gold and silver, 
one of the most common materials in these parts of the world. You notice many 
halls leading in all directions; servants and maids rush about, trying to 
please the royal family. You notice a giant stairway leading to a second floor 
belcany. The exits are east, through a giant hall, and west, through 
the palace doors.

An Elegant Massive Hall~
You have entered a giant massive hall. The walls are lines with 
tapestries  of all kinds, telling stories of war, conquests, invasions, 
magic, love, trust, evil and several others. Giant slabs of white marble 
with the odd splash of gold, cover the floor. Large statues of brave warriors, 
ancient rulers and the wise ones line the hall, creating a historical look. 
A giantdoorway to the east leads into the beautiful throne room. To the
west of this room lies the doorway you came through.

The Throne Room~
Behold! The King and Queen of The Titans! Such a spectacular room! This 
is the most impressive room in all of Thera! The kings and queens of Thalos 
would never believe in such beauty! Such a wonderful place has not been build 
since the times of legends, but perhaps this is right out of that era. Large 
green thrones sit high in this room. The King and The Queen have faces that
look as though they have never aged. The queen's advisors are about you, 
aiding her with the disisions of the future of the caslte. The only exit to 
this room is west, back to the massive hall.

A Secret Passage Behind The Throne~
You have sumbled on a secret passage behind the throne. You realize that 
there is an assassin here, stalking the king and queen! You better report him, 
and this room, or kill him yourself! I am sure the king and queen will pay 
highly for his head. This assassin appears to be very talented.

The Room of The Deadly Beasts~
Mystical beasts fill this room, all rather tame, yet all with a deadly 
power. Each beast brought from a far and magical place, to serve young foolish 
mortals. Beware, they have not eaten and you look mighty tasty right now. 
A sign is on the wall, writen in blood. It reads:
 
     "BE GONE! You do not belong here! If I catch you here, messing 
		     with my pets I shall SLAY you!"

     The Keeper of The Deadly Pets.
Freaky! There is no exit! Aaaahahhhhhhh.h........h.......!
