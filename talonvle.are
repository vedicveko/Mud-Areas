Grand Hall of Caraway~
You stand in the grand hall of the Castle of Caraway.  All around you,
courtiers hurry here and there, talking in low whispers.  A chill air lies
upon the castle, as if some great doom had befallen the inhabitants.  A red
velvet carpet runs down the middle of the hall, leading north into the
Throne room, and south into the foyer.  East and west lie lesser hallways.

Throne Room~
You stand in a large room with huge arching windows.  You pause for a
moment to admire the windows, which are stained glass representations of
roses in glory and unicorns.  Then your eyes are drawn to the head of the
room, where two golden thrones sit.  The courtiers of the court part for you
as you approach the monarchs of this grand castle.  There is an aura of
despair and sorrow that seem to congeal about you almost physically as you
draw nearer the king and queen.  You see that the queen is sobbing quietly
into her handkerchief and the king is grimly talking to several of his
knights.  He sees you and beckons you forward with a glad cry.

A Large Tunnel~
You stumble down the steep slope and glance about you once you've
regained your balance.  You stand once again in a dark tunnel that heads
east.  You peer into the darkness, wondering what vile beasts might be
concealed there.

A Large Tunnel~
You begin to wonder if this tunnel will ever end.  You have been all
turned around by the twists and turns, and you peer down another steep
slope, wondering if you can ever find your way home again.  The screams are
growing louder, which is the only thing that convinces you that you are
heading in the right direction.

A Large Tunnel~
You can feel a moist heat blowing towards you from the west.  It is
scented with brimstone and ash, and you think that you have maybe come
towards the end of this tunnel at last.  You eagerly stride forward, ready

The End of the Tunnel~
At last you have reached the end of the dark, winding tunnel that you
have been climbing through for what feels like hours.  You peer down into
the cavern below, lighted fitfully by pools of fire and lava.  You can't
make out any details, but you can almost feel the sullen menace of the
dragon.

You stop with shock as you recognize the dejected figure before you as
Sir Lauren.  His silver and white armor is dented and scratched, and his
sword dangles limply from his fingers.  He gazes at you with a listlessness
you can scarcely believe and sighs.  He does not respond to any of your
questions about what might be wrong, instead gazing at the cavern wall and
sulking.

Gilda in Repose~
You enter a huge chamber, filled with trinkets and gems and gold.  In the
center of the room, a huge featherbed sits.  Sitting in the center of the
bed, Gilda, dressed in very little (other than a little bit of jewelry)
reclines, nibbling on a bon-bon and reading a romance.  She glances up at
you and sighs.  "So, another would be hero, hmm?"  She says.  "Why can't you
people get it through your heads.  I'm happy here.  Sir Lauren is such a
putz (especially in bed).  The dragon keeps me much more ....  Satisfied. 
I'll never leave him."  She grins evilly.  "He really knows how to eat a
maiden, if you catch my drift."  She chuckles, and then goes back to her
book.  She glances up once more after a moment and says, " For
clarification, read the tapestry on the wall."  She goes back to ignoring
you then.

Gilda and the Dragon
By Cynthia McQuillin
 
Sir Lauren undertook a quest, the maiden Gilda seeking,
He found her in a dragon's bed, from neath the covers peeking.
 
"What seek you here, Sir Lauren, dear?" The dragon asked with guile.
The noble knight could not but note the dragon's sated smile.
 
"Why smilest thou, Lord Dragon, Sir?" Asked our hero in armor laden,
"Why, you'd smile too, the worm replied, "If you'd just eaten a maiden."
 
"Such candor," this young lordling cried, "must touch upon dishonor!"
The dragon grinned his lecherous grin, and once more was upon her.
 
"Cease and desist!" Sir Lauren cried, his fine steel blade a-flashing,
"Oh, slay him not," young Gilda cried, her voice a play of passion.
 
"Was ever a maid so tried as I, betwixt desire and honor?
"I should demand you slay the beast, but he stirs in me such....ardor!"
 
"Fie, fie!!!" Sir Lauren cried to her, "What foolishness is this?
"Would you deny your lord and lands, all for a dragon's kiss?"
 
Intently he did search her face, then frowned in deep dismay,
For she shed a tear, for honor's sake, and then sent him away.
 
"Why smilest thou, Lord Dragon, Sir?" Asked our hero in armor laden,
"Why, you'd smile too, the worm replied, "If you'd just eaten a maiden."

On a road~
You walk northward along a winding road.  You have left the forest far to
the south, and are now walking amid deserted fields.  In the distance you
can see a castle rising above the mists, and there is a faint tang of soot
and brimstone in the air.  You shiver as a cold breeze blows across the back
of your neck, and you glance upwards, not even certain what you're searching
for.

The trail leads from the forest into a light scattering of woods.  You
breath in the deep scent of pine and apple.  All around you the forest is
buzzing with life.  Songbirds sing in the trees, and you see a flash of
white that means deer inhabit these woods.  The trail continues to the
north, where you can sense a sort of stillness in the air.
