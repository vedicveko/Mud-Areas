*Kaan's Holy Thieven Temple
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This zone was a perfect example o how egotistical I truly am, an entire
zone devoted to my token class, Thieves, and to the God of Thieves on Dibrova,
Kaan.

The Temple is surrounded by a maze which is traversable by reading notes
that are left in each room, each with one letter on them.  Each way that
a player can take says something flattering about me when all put together, 
but I believe the one that says simply 'Kaan God of Thieves' is the route to
take.  At any rate, at the end, where a player gets to the temple entrance
which is guarded by two drunk guards who won't let any player pass, only a
thief.  Should piss all the non-thief players off pretty good once they
finally find their way through the maze, eh?  Also, every wrong direction
ends up at a room which takes the player to a random point in the mud, all
non-aggro spots.

There is a suite of rooms in the upper level of the temple which can be
set aside for players to buy (thieves only), a thieven weapon shop, armor
shop, misc thieven goods, and a thieven garden with poisonous plants growing
and of course, a bit of weed ;-)

Take it if you like.  If you cannot surrender yourself to my ego, then by all
means, leave it to rot on this webpage.
