A Tunnel~
This is a dimly lit tunnel.  Light floods in from above showing a
narrow staircase hewn from the rock.  The staircase leads up and appears
to be the way out of this area.  The tunnel gets darker and narrower to
the east.

be no exit except to the north.  Tiny gems in the walls sparkle and catch
the light, the source of which cannot be determined.  There is something

A Misty Path~
A desolated pathway greets your arrival.  Mists buffet the surrounding
trees rendering them bereft of their leaves.  A pathway up shimmers in

mists.  Gravestones and old bones materialise into view, casting a chill
into the atmosphere.

An Easter Tableau~
Rolling hills and grassy meadows portray the season of Spring, with
new growth springing up joyously to embrace the world.  Buds open
gracefully turning their pretty heads towards the sunshine and delighting
in its warmth and radiance.  Birds flit around from branch to branch,
twittering happily, not stopping long enough to settle.

Waves wash up against the shore, the multitude of sealife scurrying back

A Time to Celebrate~
A joyous occasion greets the eyes here.  A table laden with fine foods
to give thanks and to commemorate the first settlers from the Mayflower
to the Plymouth colony in 1620.  The celebration of Thanksgiving was
first started to give thanks to the native Americans who so generously
helped those from across the seas.  It is also observed as an
acknowledgement of the divine favours received during the year.
