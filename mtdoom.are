lord krothgar~
the Lord Krothgar~
The Lord Krothgar glares balefully at you.
~
Krothgar, standing at over eight feet tall and clad in full spiked black
plate mail, is an imposing... man. It is said his fists have the power to
rend the very earth asunder if he is angered. It is small wonder the dark
powers have chosen him as their fell agent on Anon.

death knight~
a death knight~
A death knight gazes evilly at you.
~
This fellow and his comrades are servants of the demon lord Marmandes, and
will take only his orders, despite the fact that Krothgar could probably
crush him (and definitely them) with little effort. Krothgar tolerates their
presence in honor of the alliance he has forged with the dark powers to
facilitate the conquest of Anon.

marmandes demon prince~
the demon prince Marmandes~
The demon prince Marmandes watches you curiously.
~
Marmandes has been sent here by his evil masters to observe and aid their
servant Krothgar, and as such he will prefer to avoid direct combat, being
greatly weaker on this plane than on his native, and being eager to see how
Krothgar performs. This does not mean that he will fail to defend himself
to the best of his considerable abilities if the need arises.

Approaching the Plains of Mount Doom~
You are heading directly toward Mount Doom, on a narrow path that leads to
the desolate, monster-infested plains that surround it. This is the fell
domain of Lord Krothgar, whose forbidding black fortress can be seen atop the
peak of the extinct volcano called by humans Mount Doom. Armies of giants
patrol the lower slopes, while evil mutants, mages and demons guard the
fortress itself. Steeling yourself, you push on.

The Plains of Mount Doom~
A chill wind blows across the desolate wastes, and you shiver uncomfortably
as you proceed. The bones of past adventurers lay scattered across the
hard ground, among rusted weapons and shards of jagged rock that resemble
teeth. It almost looks as if the very earth had devoured them. But the
sudden howl of a warg (or a ghoul) alerts you to the very real dangers
lurking nearby and you press on.

The Foothills of Mount Doom~
You have come to the base of the mountain. From here you may continue to
slowly make your way up the mountain, or head back to the eerie plains below.
The ground here is rocky and treacherous, dotted by small crevices in the
volcanic rock and jagged shards of granite protrustions. The wind is even
stronger here than on the plains, and you fancy you can hear voices and
screams.

You are steadily drawing near the summit. The ground has become quite smooth

footing on the glassy obsidian that coats the upper slopes. The fortress
of Lord Krogthar looms closer than ever now, and you mentally prepare
yourself for the the upcoming battles. The foes you have fought so far have
been minor compared to those to come.

The Foothills of Mount Doom~
You have come to the base of the mountain. From here you may continue to
slowly make your way up the mountain, or head back to the eerie plains below.
The ground here is rocky and treacherous, dotted by small crevices in the
volcanic rock and jagged shards of granite protrustions. The wind is even
stronger here than on the plains, and you fancy you can hear voices and
screams.

The Upper Slopes of Mount Doom~
You are steadily drawing near the summit. The ground has become quite smooth
here, to the point of sliperiness, and you stop more than once to regain your
footing on the glassy obsidian that coats the upper slopes. The fortress
of Lord Krogthar looms closer than ever now, and you mentally prepare
yourself for the the upcoming battles. The foes you have fought so far have
been minor compared to those to come.

The Fortress lies directly east of here.

Outside the Fortress of Lord Korgthar~
You have finally reached the summit, and are standing beneath the gates of
the Fortress, which you may climb up to by means of an iron staircase. You
can sense many pairs of eyes upon you, and you wonder how far you will be
permitted to go before Korgthar's forces combine and crush you.

stones on floor and walls, the monotony broken only by the occasional torch
sconce or tattered tapestry. It is evident that this castle has known many
inhabitants prior to its current ones.
