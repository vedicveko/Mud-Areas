On the Star Ferry~
This ferry is making its way across the harbour.  This is the open
area in first class.  It is a bit breezy but at least there is a roof so
that the passengers are protected from the elements.  There is a perfect
view of both sides of the harbour.  To the south, there is another ferry
just beginning its crossing and to the west there is a junk in the
distance.  What a picture that would make with a sunset behind it.  The

Below the surface of the water isn't any cleaner either.  What was
floating on the surface is nothing compared to what lies on the sea bed. 
Jagged concrete pylons, rough steel spikes, and ....  Is that a body?

that there doesn't appear to be any exit apart from up.

Star Ferry Docks - Victoria~
This is the famous Star Ferry dock area.  To board the ferry, you must
first buy a ticket.  There is a turnstile here which is 'unlocked' by
using the ticket you have bought.  There are two ferries waiting in the
docks, one unloading passengers from Kowloon side and the other waiting
for more passengers before making the crossing to the other side.  There
is a large sign here.

These are the murky waters of the harbour.  Perhaps this wasn't such a

water.  Fragrant harbour?  Wherever did that name come from?!  There is a
sudden whiff of diesel fuel.  To the west there is a cloud of black smoke
pumping out of a junk.  No, it's not on fire.  It does appear to be using
an engine though instead of pure wind power.  So much for the romantic

and normal forms of transport is somewhat suspicious in itself.  The

Red Lion Bar~
This rather tacky bar has a long high bar along one wall with bar
stools fixed to the ground.  On the other side of the room are booths
with cheap leather-look bench seats and formica topped tables.  Towards
the back of the room, in the gloom, are yet more booths as well as signs
indicating the toilets.  The door to the south leads out into the street.

Peking Restaurant~
This is yet another part of the dining area in the restaurant, though
this part is near the kitchens and therefore not as desirable a position
as some of the other tables, although the food will definitely be hot! 
There are a couple of large round tables here, to seat ten or more
people, with the special serving disc in the middle of the table to make
it easier for everyone to get at the dishes whilst they are hot.  There
is a discreet screen in the corner of the room and the door to the north

This is another part of the dining area in the restaurant but this one

to be busy at all times of the day and night, and you can well see how it
has a mighty reputation for good food and service.  The kitchens lie to

This is the bottom of a set of steep narrow stairs with only a dim
bare lightbulb lighting the way.  Old tatty cardboard boxes block part of
the passageway.  This obviously isn't the fire escape.  Yet it looks as
though this narrow corridor is somewhat used from the sheer lack of
cobwebs...  Plus there are voices coming from the north or could that
just be the hubbub of conversation upstairs?  There is no apparent way
but back up to the restaurant.  Probably best to just go back upstairs. 
This is where they keep cardboard boxes, that's all.  Really.
