Writhing black masses of steaming tentacles emerge from large round pink
juicy holes in the sides of tall massive overgrown stone sentinels either side
of a bright red corvette which lies upside down providing shelter for hapless
refugees and a skanky British diplomat in high heels next to an oil refinery
that escaped Thatcherism under red skies clouded with gray raindrops the size
of refectories that have been filled with disposable lunch bags made in a tiny
nation somewhere near Angkor and have been left to rot as a result of rabid
imperialism and soothsayers telling numberless lies to irritated masses who
are unhappy but don't know why.

Gittish Yiddish prophets speak idiocy in banal debates with Semitic spokesmen
from another race while pawns of governments too big to ignore wax lyrical
on the laws of man as long as they can exercise command and then there is
some superior knowledge cast unto the vortex, a whirling cesspool from which
sprang all that is corruptible and virgin in the world that we no longer know
nor care to in a format we no longer can comprehend at any level.

Foolish pride makes weak the eager youth who like no other goes to where he

Irridescent flashes of colors beyond your mortal ken assault your senses in
a warm and fuzzy globe of incoherence that you struggle to deny because you
cannot accept the insanity that is the norm on any political platform to
which you are subsequently subjected.

A Zoo emerges triumphant from the misty confines of the mortal world, bearing
with it a cargo of strange animals like none you have ever seen and you marvel
at their incredible physiology as they are led into a stinking vat of
processed food and turned into what your pet eats.

A river of blood rushes past you, threatening to carry you off to its source,
you struggle and reject its evil offering and continue through a diabolical
wasteland populated by midgets scared to climb down from the trapezes they
have been hung from.

A myriad of multi-colored birds fly in fixed formation across an ochre sky
toward a huge nest made of twisted steel girders that lies atop seven hills
covered with dead Goths and Romans that cause you to look aside in dismay
lest you be drawn into their conflicts without your written consent.

Sudden slashes of bright light cut across a dark velvet tapestry covered
with a stunningly-well rendered mosaic of an ancient people in an ancient
land constructing ancient temples to ancient gods and you fight back a strange
feeling of deja vu as you feel the inhabitants of this world stare back at you
across the intervening milennia.

A strange high-pitched whining emerges from energetic power tools which
operate independent of any human controller as they hack and smash at a tiny
altar carved of the bedrock of the mountains that once surrounded this place
but were long ago destroyed by callous miners and bored Dwarves.

You suddenly scream as you are bombarded with a plethora of images from your

hideousness and you lurch backward, revolted to the core by this sudden
apparition and you find yourself hurtling toward the ground at near-light
speed before you realize you never left it.

A vast plain stretches as far as you can see in all directions, including up
and down, and you pause to collect your bearings seconds before being
bombarded by a horde of tiny angry tourists who begin to kick and bite at
you before asking you to take their photographs, the thought of which makes
you ill as you gaze upon their horrid bermuda shorts and panama hats doubtless
bought at some cheap department store in the midwest for $3.99 each.
