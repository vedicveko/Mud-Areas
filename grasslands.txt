*Rahn Grasslands
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This is an area designed for exp gain geared toward the low to mid-level
player.  The mobs are all aggro and sneak, as they are plainsmen and
live in the high grasses in this zone.  The zone is basically a large
square of connected rooms with a space in the center for a road to cut
through, running north to south - that road is in the Light Forest if
you desire to use the Light Forest zone as well.  There is a windmill
in the northwest quadrant of this zone, also a zone available to download.

No objs are included with this zone as it is strictly meant as a filler
zone made for good exp.
