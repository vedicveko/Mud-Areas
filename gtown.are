#HELPS
0 'GHOST TOWN'~
This is purely a simple hack-n-slash area with the interesting added feature
that you can't recall... You have to fight your way through the many powerful
high level undead that populate this place. To a good mudder its heaven. To
someone who flees when fighting the children in Mud School, its probably gonna
be considered impossible. Either way, have fun.

The Town~
You have reached the Ghost Town, a place rumored to be inhabited by the
most ghastly of undead, as well as their fell minions. Should you proceed,
you may find yourself unable to return home by conventional means, and
instead have to travel through until you find another means of escape. Your
choice.

The Main Street~
Stepping onto this street, you immediately feel a wave of fear and dread
wash over you. Shaking, you collect yourself and prepare to advance into
this literally god-forsaken area. Houses line the street to the left and
right. Up ahead lies a small town square.

A Staircase~
This staircase is an ancient stone structure that looks far older than the
other structures in the village. You peer down in an attempt to ascertain
what may below, but can see only darkness.

A Murky Mist~
You are plowing through a thick mist that has suddenly enshrouded the trail.
You can still make it out beneath your feet, but only barely. Howls, screams
and shouts of anger and terror ring out on all sides, and you feel fear 
clutching at your heart.

to the east.

Outside The Crypt~
The small stone building is actually a crypt, which is in good condition,
not surprising considering the nature of the current inhabitants of this
ghoulish town. A large iron door looms to the east, and you notice runes
inscribed into its surface in silver.

runes door~
The runes on the door read-

  "Here is the final resting place of the Evil Baron Shereck, former
   tyrant of the Barony of Palem, and his two foul brothers. Imprisoned
   here by the powerful magic of Xanad, the ArchMage of Anon, their
   rest may not be disturbed by their undead allies. Pray, whoever reads
   this, do not breach this portal, for you will once again unleash their
   undead madness upon the world."

Inside The Crypt~
The interior of the crypt is dark, damp and cramped. It looks as though
no-one has been here in centuries. A layer of dust ankle-deep makes progress
difficult, as do the hanging cobwebs, with strands as thick as your wrist.
You hope you don't run into the spinner of these webs.

The Crypt Proper~
Three doors and a staircase allow escape from this area, and that is a
prominent urge you have right now as you glance about the hellish murals
on the walls, and the rotting corpses hanging in metal frames from the 
arched ceiling.

A Room In the Crypt~
These three resting places that lead off the Crypt's main chamber are all
identical- a raised stone sarcophagus with a bas-relief of the image of its
occupant in life embossed on the lid. Other than that, the place is bare. Or
is it...?

the life drained from them by some disturbingly healthy looking plants with
thorns that look like teeth...

small hole in the center of the path which was partially covered by a nest
of branches.

The Garden~
You find yourself lost in a tangled maze of thorny bushes and rotted trees
that all seem to move as if with a life of their own. Howls and screams of
pain and delight occasionally rent the still air- otherwise you are engulfed
by a silent dimness that only exaggerates the already-eerie quality of
your surroundings.

The Garden~
You suddenly enter a brightly-lit glade full of towering oaks and fresh,

this realm of darkness, to aid those stranded or trapped here. You may rest
in peace (if you'll pardon the inappropriate euphemism) for as long as you
wish here.

at least 90% sure you have entered the lair of one...

the tunnel is so narrow you doubt you'd be able to return through it.
