"Sym"
and
"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

The painted arrows are skewed in all directions, as if the maker couldn't
decide which way they should point and made arrows in all directions just
to be safe.  Which makes it pretty useless as a signpost.. but it looks

shimmering letters are visible amidst the swirling matter of the circlets:

  in this web of silver wires
  thinner than thread
  and brighter than steel
  we wander --
  dazzled by myriad glints,
  pulsing with knowledge
  and glowing with power...
  And in that glow,

  we know
  and yet are decieved

  we thrive
  and yet we drown

  we grow
  and we are dwarfed

  we are alone
  and never lonely

  we are lost
  and we are found.

  Reaching into the icy darkness
  and for an instant
  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.

the path here.  Water spews from one hippo's mouth into the basin below.

* CHANGES (since the older version - the lower level version is unchanged)
* area now takes up 200 vnums (drakyri isle was moved to 11800-11899)
* added zdreni assassin guild to shadows area
* revised equipment stats (lowered most. the really nice (crimson) eq in the
*  zdreni area is _extremely_ difficult to get, even for a level 100 player
*  (hitroll for avengers w/ crimson eq is 5, damroll 10 above normal.
*   world limit 1 on oath)
