achilles~
Achilles~
Achilles sits here, sulking.
~
Achilles is sulking in his tent due to a slight from Agamemnon. This is
unfortunate for the Achaeans, as he is their most powerful warrior. He is
favored of the gods, and possessed of supernatural defenses as he was
dipped in the Styx while a babe. He was given a choice long ago to live a
long but uneventful life, or a short but action-filled life, and he chose
the latter.

died.

The Gates of Ilium loom before you, tall and magnificent. They are crafted
