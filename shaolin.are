The Grand Hall~
This massive hall contains figurines of the Buddha in all sort of sizes and
positions. Towering above all of them, is a huge golden statue of a sleeping 
Buddha.  Directly in front of it, is a huge stone table for offerings.
Exits lead west and east to side halls, while south leads you back to the
Main Court.

This room looks empty except for a hard bed, a table and some chairs. It
looks extremely well kept, so make sure you do not dirty it.  You better

A Mysterious Room~
The door above you closes and effectively seals off your exit. The walls 
of this strange room glow and hum as if it is alive. This is where the 
body of the high monks are kept after they attain enlightenment. These
bodies are embalmed and preserved using gold, hence they are sometimes 
referred to as "Jinshen". A stairway leads down.
