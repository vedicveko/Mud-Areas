A Path Through the Forest~
You are walking along a path through a dense forest.  Beautiful trees of
numerous variety stands on either side, their boughs casting a comfortable
shade over your head.  It appears the ground here was razed long ago, and
nature has still failed to reclaim it for herself.  As you walk along you
hear the scamper of tiny feet into the brush at your approach, along with
the happy chirping of the many birds that call this place home.  The path
continues east and west.

the ancient elms and oaks.  West the path winds gently down to a beach,
where the base of a brilliant golden bridge glimmers in the sunlight over
a shimmering sea of blue.

You are standing on the white sandy shore of a long beach.  The coastline

of blue sparkles as it reflects the sun's rays.  A path leading down from
a dense forest off to the east meets the base of a giant golden bridge here,
which spans the sea as it crosses to an island kingdom to the west.  The 
bridge is of beautiful construction, arcing up smoothly into the air then 
down at the shore of the island.  The bridge gleams brightly against the 
shining sun, and you wonder if there is a place as beautiful as where you
are now in all of Aesir.

island, upon which sits a city encircled by a giant wall of white stone.
Above the wall you can see many gleaming turrets, and a small flag fluttering
in the wind.  The bridge lands on the shore right before a set of tall
silver gates in the stone wall, which are now open to all travellers who
seek refuge from the wild.  East the bridge meets the mainland, and in the
distance you see a massive forest stretch into the distance.

following the shore around the edge of the island.  Where the wall breaks,
two mighty gates of solid silver stand thrown open, offering entrance to
you and any other adventurers who pass this way.  The end of a mighty golden
bridge meets the shore here, and arcs off to the east above a glimmering
sea to meet the mainland.  Overhead seagulls soar through the air, crying out
occasionally as they speed over the surf.

and cater to travellers just entering town or on the way out for some great
adventure.  A building with a silver globe over the door sits to the north,
with the name Maps Express etched into a glass window.  South, large plate
glass windows reveal fresh meats and breads ready for your picking at

you can hear the 'ding!' of metal against metal, as the owner busies himself
crafting yet more weaponry.  Sensing a customer, the black curtain parts and
Dolgan enters the room, coughing slightly then winking at you with a smile.

by a beautiful pond of crystal-clear water, filled with gorgeous white swans
floating about lazily as they stretch their long graceful necks toward 
the sun.  Families walk about here, and children reach into small bags and
throw food to the swans.  To the east and west, Shorecrest Avenue runs 
through the nicer neighborhoods of town, and Sunnyvale Lane heads south 
toward the glitterings spires of the palace in the distance.  The 
towering gold doors of Aesir University are thrown open to the north, 
offering entrance to all who seek to enhance their education.
