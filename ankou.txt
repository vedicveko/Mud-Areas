*The Realm of Lord Ankou
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This is a forest zone surrounded on all four sides by an unscalable cliff
face.  It is meant to hold four zones; Banshide, the Haunted House, the
Castle of the Vampyre, and the Witch's Hollow.  All but the Witch's Hollow
are available for download, as the Hollow is not yet complete.

This is an extremely high level zone, meant for 40-50groups, the mobs are
often aggro, Lord Ankou himself drives a band of spectral minions before his
cart which he rides throught the forest, so players not only have to contend
with Ankou as the highest level mob, but also his minions who will fight
for their Lord to the death.  The code for the minions to follow Ankou
can be found on the snippets page.

This was originally intended to connect to the farmlands, at their western-
most side at the chasm.  The farmlands are also available for download.  The
lack of a way out of this zone is intentional, just a little thing to get
players stark raving mad when visiting here if they forget to bring a recall.
