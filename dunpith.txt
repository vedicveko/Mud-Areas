Dun Pith is a sprawling city set back in an area where few of the
affluent dare to travel. It was originally built with the intent
that it be a cultural center, place where folk of all races could
come and learn arts of various natures. All of the major guilds
from all over the world were invited to Dun Pith to come set up
shop but only the darker, shadier guilds accepted the invitation.
They set up shop and soon took the city over, waging war upon one
another and all who would dare to enter.
