*Mordecai's Village
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


Mordecai is a pagan worshipper of a God that does not exist.  He possesses
an extreme charisma, though, and has gathered together a large following
where he has established his own village, or more aptly put - cult.

His main goal is money, so he has stolen the Lord's daughter, Penelope (see
Lord's Keep, also available for download) in order to ransom her off.

The entrance into this zone is made to be a trap - the original intent was
to have a spec_proc on a room that would teleport a player every few ticks
into the Holding Cell, a message displayed to the player that they were
captured by Mordecai's guards.  In the cell is a hole that does not show up
in the room descrip, but is there and the key is there to the door.

Midlevel mobs and eq, with a bit of fun in the descrips.  Enjoy.
