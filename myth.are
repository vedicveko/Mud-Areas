cheerful and friendly as he tends to his resturaunt.

Chumly~
Chumly~
Chumly is ready to turn you into a lean mean ... something or other.
~
Chumly is BIG and UGLY but don't let his act fool you.
Not all trolls rip the arms off of everyone they meet...
He speaks in a slight English accent and tends to be a but
timid.  He is also the older brother of Tananda, who obviously
got all the good looks. 

Chumly can help you practice skills and spells, train attributes and gain
spells and skill groups.

The Bazzar at Deva~
The portal has transferred you to the dimension of Deva, home of the Deevals
who are notorious hagglers and salesman.  The M.Y.T.H. Inc. offices are 
nearby so hurry along before one of the merchants tries to make you a deal. 
A sign is tacked up on a post.

The Even Odds~
Formerly a bar and bookmaking operation owned by a dishonest Deeval 
the Even Odds was purchased and then renovated by M.Y.T.H. Inc. and
now serves as a second home for the offices.  Despite the new facade
a table is always ready for a "friendly" round of dragon-poker.

The Yellow Crescent Inn~
The smell of greasy food and the scent of frying burgers hangs in the air
of this small brick building with a large yellow crescent shaped sign out
front.  The food looks barely edible but the service is impressive.

The Vitalogy Health Club~
Owned and operated by M.Y.T.H. Inc. this health club is like no-other.
The first thing you notice is the loud Seattle-rock music playing over the
PA system... the next is the ferocious looking Troll in the center of the
room.

Equipment Center~
You can barely walk through all the articles laying on the floor...
The employees of M.Y.T.H. Inc. come here to pick-up or drop spare equipment
that fellow employees have left behind.

The Foyer~
WHOA...from the outsides this place appears to be a rundown little tent
but thanks to cutting edge of dimension-modifying technology it is actually
a 120 room mansion complete with courtyard and stables.  Since the purchase
of the Even Odds this building has served as a residential palace for the
employees of M.Y.T.H. Inc.

Den of Aahz~
All I can say is this room is a MESS!  The floor is cluttered with what
appear to be utility bills and returned check notices & empty beer bottles
seem to inhabit every available inch of shelf-space. While sifting through  
the trash you happen upon what appears to be a rather shaggy looking beast, 
at closer inspection it turns out to be a designer sofa with a plush Muppet-
fur apoulstry.  A flimsy-looking mesh hammock is tied up in the corner and
something (or someone) else is tied up in the closet.
