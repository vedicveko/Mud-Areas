Dedicated, efficient, loyal and courageous, James Bond is the pride of MI6.

The Road to Movie Land~
You are walking north along a road that leads toward a rather bizarre place
called a Film Studio. You have heard that here they capture people's actions
on celluloid and sell it to the public at ludicrous prices. When you think
of some of the pretty incredible adventures you have had yourself, you decide
it is time to buy a 35mm and cash in on them.

Entrance to Movie Land~
You have entered the grounds of the movie studio, and are moving between the
sets on the various sound stages. The sets are so stunningly real that you
have to stop and remind yourself they aren't real. Or aren't they? Funny how
the place seems curiously absent of film crews... Exits lead in all directions 
past many interesting locations.

sign~
This area created by Yaegar in January 1996. It is a collage of scenes from
his favorite (and not-so-favorite) films. The sets are thrown together semi-
randomly, as it is on a film studio lot, where you can walk from a scene of
polar exploration into a roaring inferno. There are lots of high level aggies,
so be careful, but they are sentinel, so you need only use scan (and common 
sense) to detect them.

Have fun!

Deepest Enemy Territory~
You are creeping slowly through the jungle. You hear shouts, screams and the

of gunfire and grenades exploding. Blood is splattered across the thick

Approaching the Fort~
You are heading west toward a fort in Algeria flying the French flag. 
Legionaires stroll the battlements, keeping their eyes out for Bedouin raiders.
The gate is almost directly in front of you.

Inside the Fort~
Legionaires gaze at you curiously as you enter, but since you are not clad
in traditional 19th century Bedouin garments (at least its likely you're not)
the don't attempt to attack you.

Gay Paris~
How odd. One minute you were in gloomy, fog-bound 19th century London, the
next you emerge into gay Paris in the 1960s. Men wearing funny striped shirts
and black berets, and wielding long sticks of bread cycle past you, heading
to and fro in front of the Eiffel Tower. Even as you watch, the Tower suddenly
shimmers and disappears altogether. A voice yells "Look for it in Pepperland".
How odd.

The Police Station~
You are standing outside a rather large building, which has been firmly
barricaded to keep people out, or rather, a particular person out. This person
is standing outside, on the footpath next to you, frantically calling out
in French to a police inspector huddled inside, who is gibbering madly.

You are inside what looks like a rehearsal room for some big name Hollywood

You have stumbled onto a NY drug bust. Cops run everywhere, shooting and

you have entered some sort of war movie. Suddenly you yelp as a piece of
shrapnel imbeds itself in your calf, and you suddenly realize- You could be

Oops. The officer couldn't make it past the fence, and neither can you. Looks

idly sip at martinis as they sit in their tents and watch the passing parade,
preparing to once again do another twelve hours in the surgery fixing these
wounded up.

"We're OFF to see the Wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz!" Bleech.

You better head back- this place isn't right for you.
