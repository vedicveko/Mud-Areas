Many years ago, a cabal of powerful wizards known as the High Magi
conducted a series of experiments on laboratory test animals, in an
attempt to grant these simple beasts a level of sentience equivalent to or
superior to their own. For decades their efforts, and the efforts of their
descendants, met with dismal failure.
     Then one day, a brilliant younge mage known as Ceraphem stumbled 
across a mystical tome in the foothills of G'hal that contained the
total knowledge of the ancient Animage Gor-Kheebler. Elated with his find,
Cerapham rushed home to the stony fortress of Teut-Rhogar, that he and his
associates shared with some Dwarven priests, and set to work on their
experiments, this time following instructions given in Gor-Kheebler's tome.
     Soon afterward, strange beasts began to emerge from Teut-Rhogar's
forbidding heights, animals that could walk and talk and interact with
their creators on a level of sophistication that would have impressed even
Gor-Kheebler himself. The cabal were amazed, and continued to pour out
their creations, animals of all types granted remarkable acuity and skill.
     But the humans that lived at the foot of the mountains that housed
the fortress grew restless, then angry towards the mages and their
creations. Calling it heresy, they continued to grow agitated until one
day they sent an emissary to the Dwarves hosting the cabal that unless
the experiments ceased and the animals were destroyed, the nearby human
towns would cease to buy ore from the dwarves or provide them with the
food that they could not provide for themselves. The Dwarves of course
refused, slaying the emissary, but the cabal were concerned for the safety
of their allies and began to plan how to spirit the animals away.
     It was Ceraphem who once again brought salvation to his friends. He
knew of a knigdom many miles away that had once flourished with Elves and
Kender, but which was now uninhabited due to the decline in populations
of these two races, and he suggested that the Animals and Dwarves be given 
haven there. All instantly agreed, and they set out.
     Upon reaching the kingdom, the animals set up an administrative and
political system, and soon were coping quite well without their creators'
guiding hand. However, Ceraphem worried for their safety, and thus cast
an enchantment that none may ever leave the bounds of Animaland that was
an animal. Furhtermore, he called upon a favour owed him by the Knights
of the Order of the Liver, and they pledged to establish a guard post
at the entrance to Animaland, staffing it at all times with their best
knights.
     And so it has remained over the intervening years till today. The
Order of the Liver grew decadent however, and these days only one knight
remains in the tower near the entrance, and even then only because he
felt obliged to live up to the oath made by his more honorable ancestors.
When he dies, there will be no-one to protect Animaland, but the Animals
have gained in power, and actually have a competent defense force, as well
as a powerful wizard, a former apprentice of Ceraphem named Wizard Owl.
So feel free to enter Animaland, but respect the inhabitants, especially
the inhabitants of Animaltown, who rank amongst the most powerful creatures
in all the land of Anon.

Sir Hosis of the Liver stands before you.
~
Sir Hosis is a brave, proud man of middle years, who has sworn by
his God and his Honour to protect Animaland from harm until death
takes him from this world. He is a just man, though, and is more
than helpful and courteous to peaceful visitors.

A Knight who says "Ni!" demands a shrubbery from you.

This fellow is a rather odd, demented knight who has fallen from
his role as a protector of animal town to a lordless wanderer cursed
by the Witch to seek out shrubberies. The whole affair has made him
rather crabby, and he's likely to take it out on you!

The First Little Pig oinks petulantly at you.

This stout little porker is the rather unwise porcine chap who built
his adobe from straw, infuriating insurance assessors and tempting
the BBW (Big Bad Wolf) into detroying it, until the pig's older brother
helped him out and deterred BBW from such activities.

This progressive porker decided to advance on his brother's work and
build a house of wood, slightly more attractive, but no less safe from
the BBW (not to mention nasty draughts and forest fires). He also ran
to the eldest pig for succor, and now everything's jake (for now).

This pig is a rather overbearing fellow with a nasty temper, but he is
nonetheless quite bright (he built his house of brick, remember?), and
fiercely protective of his younger brothers. He does not look 
particularly happy to see you...This is not surprising considering the
fact that you've most probably jsut slain his brethren swine...

resident nearby:))).

The Path leading to Animaland~
You are strolling along a well-trodden path that leads towards the
boundaries of the mysterious realm of Animaland. At this point it
may not be inappropriate to consult your history books and learn
about the place (type `help animaland'). You see a broad, swiftly-
flowing river up ahead, which you can cross via a ford. However,
a well-armored knight standing outside a stone tower near the ford
makes you hesitate...

As you near the ford, you also grow nearer this weathered stone tower,
which looks older than your Aunt Ethyl... A very odd-looking coat of arms
hangs above the door, which is stoutly locked (you can't go in, so don't
bother with this 'look door', 'op n', 'op door' crap ok? :P). The ford 
look simple enough- step on and across the shallow bit to the other side,
which is very green and rather pleasant-looking.

Uh Oh...You don't know whether it's the bones and gore scattered and
smeared all over the place here, or the huge sign that reads "SOD OFF",
but SOMETHING tells you that proceeding any further into the mines may
not be too good for your health...

 White film. We are always happy to hear from famous directors such
 as yourself. However, we regret to inform you that the rape scene, the
 shoot-outs, the violent swearing witch and the Reservoir Dwarves 
 (Wretched, Perturbed, Winded, Diseased, Conceited, Vacuous and
 Lost) are not quite what we here at Disney had in mind.

		   Yours Sincerly

This was perhaps an armory at one point, but now it is little more

portrait of Quentin Tarantino is one one wall- apparently he was

his script. Consequently, Mr. Wolf had some new business to take care
of in Hollywood...

the scent of cow...

Cowntess Heifer's Chamber~
This luxurious boudoir is packed with every kind of Bovine pleasure
conceivable, plus many you never even knew about. Shelf upon shelf
are packed with hundreds of trinkets, caskets, bells, statuettes,
objects d'art and curios gathered from half-a-lifetime as the second
richest inhabitant of Animaland. Best be quiet here- she hates being 
interrupted when in here alone...

Outside Count Poodle's Chamber~
You are standing outside Poodle's room. He is likely to be in there. In
fact, he has been in there for two weeks, hiding from his wife and her
amorous advances...he has not the endurance he once possessed as a young
pup, and thus needs a break to rest his weary bones.

Inside Poodle's Chamber~
Poodle is an effeminate kind of guy. Oh sure, he tried to act all butch,
sticking swords and stuffed human heads  and such on his walls, and wearing
butch count-type stuff, but it all ends up looking rather ridiculous. So
in the end he gave up, and reverted to form, going for new-age color schemes,
gentle modern art sculpture, and literature by camp authors.

Sailing down the Fulem~
The current grabs at your boat and swiftly bears you downstream, towards
lake Cungerell in the distant south. Birds fly high overhead, conversing 
with each other, and you imagine that you can also hear the fish in the
greeny depths beneath you quietly discussing philosophy and anthropology.

Sailing Further~
You race along the Fulem, gaining considerable speed in the grip of its
powerful current. The lake grows nearer, and you begin to hope that the
legend of the terrible beast that lives therein is just that- a legend.

Lake Cungerell~
The current propels you into the lake called by man Cungerell, and you
feel giddy as the current gradually subsides and you slow to a halt.
The mirrored surface fo the lake extends to the west and east, and you
may hoist your sail and explore.

You have reached the bottom of the lake. It is not as deep as you
at first thought, and you are disappointed to find naught but
some harmless fish. However, you have a feeling of dread, and feel
reluctant to explore further...

Owl's Study~
You have entered the Sanctum Sanctorum of The Wizard Owl. As you enter,
he regales you with a long string of calculations, asks your opinion on
their accuracy, then promptly whips out a book and begins to read. 
Momentarily ignored, you glance about the room, amazed and impressed by
the range of alembics, beakers, cisterns, decanters, eggtimers, feathers,
gemstones, hangings, items, jpegs, krators, looms, manuals, necronomicons,
objects d'art, posters, question sheets, rulers, sheets, telescopes,
ultraviolet art, vampire bats, walrus tusks, x-ray machines, yellow powders
and zoo exhibits.
