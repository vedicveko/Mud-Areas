WHAT IS THIS?

A small Elven village complete with shops, a inn, and a cave full of
low level mobs.

INSTALLING

Change all instances of QQ with the zone number you wish to use for this area.

The file formats are not Circle standard, the best way to make them like your
format would be to compare one of my zones with one of your zones and change
mine to look like yours.

All of the mobiles are build using a 50 level system, you will most likely
have to restat them.

DISTRIBUTING/CHANGING

Do what ever you want, just please put my name in your builder credits file
so I have something to stroke my ego with. Also, a nice email saying you use
my zone would be nice.
