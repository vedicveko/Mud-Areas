Wench~
Wench~
The waitress, Wench, leans over and asks you for your order.
~
Sexy doesn't begin to describe Wench.  The only one who knows this
fantastic feline's real name is Jorinth, and by the glint in his eyes, he's
not telling.  When Wench moves, eyes turn.  The tail swishes behind her
gracefully, and her hips sway in an opposite direction.  Her white fur is so
thin that you barely notice it, and her hair is so full that it covers most
of the two pointed ears at the top of her head.  She is exotic, and many
proposition her.  Few get the answer they desire.

Jorinth Durendal, the Proprietor~
Jorinth, the Proprietor~
Jorinth grants you the crooked smile of a rogueish proprietor.
~
White hair and pale, almost colorless blue eyes dazzle you with his
obvious sense of humor.  He looks you, grins, and is full of energy, but
something in his eyes speaks of secrets and age.  Nobody can tell how old
Jorinth is, but they all have rumors.  He wears a teal tunic with a black
belt, and a thin silver chain.  Flipping the glasses (and liquor) is a
specialty of his, and he never spills.  He's a clown, a barkeep, and a
friend for all.

Sir Corwyn Torymyr~
Sir Corwyn Torymyr sleeps against the Heart of Stone.
~
His russet hair hangs loose around his sleeping face.  His right arm is
crossed over his chest, and his left arm lies limp by his side.  He looks
you, and is dressed in a sort of harlequin's outfit which lends him a comic
look.  He's so peaceful the way he is, that you wonder if you should - or
could wake him.

Grumbling and grizzled, yet fully capable, the Purple Elf's Master Chef,
a dwarf, commands this kitchen like most lead a battle.  His eyes dart from

Tiny is anything but.  He's huge, and despite his broad grin you feel
he's got something more brutal than a kind greeting in his mind.  He's the
bouncer, and he's good at his job.  You can just picture some troublemaker

served with lightly garlicked butter.  Her grey eyes sparkle until they
almost seem like silver, and her hair, wispy and feathery, is a glistening

a Merchant of Antyr~
A fat merchant strolls the street here, while planning his future fortunes.
~
This fat merchant shows that money's not the only thing he hoards.  His
belly hangs over his over-stuffed pants, and his eyes seem to dart back and
forth as if reading the ledgers.  The way he sticks his nose in the air,
you'd presume he's thinking of his favorite dream - riding the waves of a
mountain of gold.  It's too bad his breath is so bad.

Madame Brandoline~
Brandoline~
Madame Brandoline lounges on the love-seat while grapes are fed to her.
~
First you see her perfect leg.  Then you see her perfect torso.  Your
eyes travel up to the sensual curves of her chest, then to the delicately
pouting lips.  She seems to exhude the aura of "come and get it, handsome." 
You notice, however, she's the only one not looking to cling to a man or
woman.

One of Antyr City's fine guards is cramped in here.
~
The Antyr City is known for its fine guards.  Nothing happens without
them knowing.  Of course, there are rumors that the thieve's guild owns
them, but none can say for certain.  This one's a female orc, with long
protruding yellow fangs hanging up from her lower jaw.  She looks bored.

Depra~
a depra~
A depra grazes here.
~
Depra are unusual beasts.  Though they look like miniature deer, they
have hooves which are longer, fangs, and their horns are wider.  The fur is
pale, usually white.  Their skins are tough, so hard that a knife can't cut
through it unless it's sharpened recently.  The inside of the fangs is
acidic, for their self-preservation, and their meat is particularly juicy. 
This one grazes - on the mice and other small creatures in the field.

grouchy farmer, and a ploughboy who prefers others, whether they be another

This arch wight screeches silently at you, ready to drain your life.
~
The ice chills to the depths of your soul.  Every howl you would hear if
there was sound reaches your heart, and freezes you.  You try to scream, but no
sound comes out.  Where you look, the figure floats, red eyes blazing, claws
out and slashing, calling, calling to come to you, bring you to your end. 
End your life, and force you to join it.  What pitiful thing was the cause
of this?

This lumberjack got stuck in the forest when the tragic crack of the
Heart of Stone happened.  Bit by bit it seeped his life away until all
that's left is what you see.  He's large, bearded, angry, and curiously
bereft of clear thought.  He stumbles toward you with no aim or purpose. 
He's evil and undead, true.  But you can't but help pity him before you
realize it's fight or flee.

Haul away, haul away, Joe.  This "Joe" is no small man, as you can tell
by the muscles that bulge when he lifts the nets full of fis.  His scraggly
beard seems to fit his image, the way a slinking walk does a seductress's
life.  He whistles when he works, and calls to his "mateys" never seeming
down, never seeming upset - except when he's had too much rum, and feels
like a fight.

gown~
This gown is gorgeous and expensive.  The forest green material hangs
over the hoop in soft pleats, rippling down until it reaches the floor.  The
bottom hem is gathered in even areas, pinned to the higher portion of the
skirt by golden brooches.  The front part of the dress parts to show the
under-skirt, which is a soft black and gold hatch-pattern.  This pattern and
material is used for the front portion of the bodice, and on the inside of
the sleeves, which hang down to the mid-thigh.  The rest of the bodice is
snugly fit around the torso, tied tightly in the back by gold and black
laces.  The puffed sleeves are echoed by a high back collar which rolls
softly at the top of the neck, just below the cranium.  The front neckline
is boxed, and pushes the breasts up to enhance the cleavage..  The hem of
the bodice is a layer of boxed greens over boxed black and gold, offset
half-way so they both show simultaneously.  All trim is in black and gold,
to finish the complete look of this very rich Lady's Gown.

corners is decorated with an intricately carved stone statue of one of the
seven deities.  Each statue has a place within it where a small object could
be fit.  It's free of dirt, entirely, and a sweet scent drifts up from its
depths.  There are many legends associated to the Well of Steabean Gods. 
One of them speaks of the possibility of summoning the deities themselves,
though if it is possible, it hasn't happened in over two hundred centuries. 
All in all, it's a spectacular tourist sight.

The Purple Elf Bar and Inn - Bar Area~
You are nearly blown out the door by the dramatic shift in volumes.  What
you might have thought to be a dead bar, when seen from the outside, you now
discover to be filled with life.  Musicians singing on and around the stage
to the west, a sleepy customer coming down the east stairs, and the barkeep
getting a message from the kitchen behind the bar.  Everywhere you go are
tables and people of all races imaginable, and some you've never believed
could be.  Just as you regain control of your senses, you find yourself led
to a table, and abandoned there.

Antyr Way~
Noises abound from the north.  The voices scream out their wares, and
children squeal with joy.  People bargain, cajole, and joke there.  It is
the main marketplace of Antyr City.  To the east, the sounds of the ocean
grow louder, and a faint touch of salt is in the air.

it.  Hm.  That's odd - you did come down a door, didn't you?  Ah, well. 
Maybe you can recall and go to the bank there.  HEY!  No!  You're stuck! 
Help!  HELP!  I'm rich!  I can pay my way out.  Is the air getting less in

The Heart of Stone~
For being under the dark forest, this room is very light.  It's a cave,
of sorts, lined with ferns, food, and some small animals and birds.  In the
center of this "clearing" is a large pink stone with a thin crack from the
top to bottom.  Against the stone sleeps a man, dressed in a Harlequin's
black and white.  The birds and animals seem to watch you expectantly,
waiting to see what you will do.

The cacophany from the pots and pans that get thrown at the assistants
blasts your eardrums.  In the center of the well-organized mess is the
ringleader...  Who moves like a blur from pot to pot.  The smell's divine. 
You'd never imagined that such a mess could make such beautiful smells.  And
more, that a dwarf would be a chef, let alone a good cook.  But it exists.

The Stage~
A rack of instruments hangs on the wall, with various styles of lutes,
flutes, violins, and drums.  You see a neatly-painted sign right above it,
and a stool right in front of it.  The area around the stage is formed into
a small hatshell, projecting the sound wonderfully into the room.  As you
glimpse down at the smooth wooden floor, you notice a thin line - perhaps
the outline of a secret door?

Thieve's Guild~
This room nearly blinds you, as it's so bright compared to the darkness
you just came from.  In the middle of the room is a large oak desk, and
standing behind that is the nastiest, coldest, most mysterious man you've
ever seen.  But then, you don't see much of him.  His eyes are shadowed by
the flat hat he wears, his clothes are all black, save a teal belt, and a
silver chain, and he's half-way hidden by the desk.  Not much else is in the
room, but you feel a thousand eyes measuring you up and down.  You see doors
around you, you think.  They all seem hazy against the walls, however, so it
might be a good idea to "feel" your way.

Guild Holding Cell~
"Close every door to me.  Keep all the world from me.  Bar all my
windows, and shut out the light."  You find yourself humming a haunting tune
of melancholy in this dank cell.  A candle is the only light, the hungry
rats the only sound.

Ah, rest.  What a comfortable and tidy room this is!  And so difficult to
get into!  But what is there for you in here?  You turn over every knob,

Training Room~
This place reeks of sweat.  Everywhere you look is training equipment. 
Ropes are attached to walls and ceilings for climbing practice and
muscle-building, there are locks against one wall for picking practice, a
wall with some rough edges for more climbing practice, not to mention
several hurdles and weights.  One thing you can assure yourself of here, you
will be trained...  Or Dundar, the Training Master might take you as his
personal "project."  And looking at Dundar, you know that's not a good
thing.

The Hallway~
This long hallway has many doors in it, but most of them are impossible
to open.  Not only don't you have the keys, the doors seem to be locked by
such means as only a Master Thief could create.  You get a tingling feeling
that the traps are even worse.  You do, however find three doors that are
easily opened - and one that, with work, might be convinced to come ajar. 
They can be found to the north, west, and south.  The locked one is above
you.

Commoner's Bedroom~
This room's not for one person.  Several beds line the walls, with
blankets, nighttables, and chests for each.  A person who hasn't much money,
but desires to sleep indoors can pay a fair price for one of these beds, and
stay here quite happily.  Curtains surround the areas, for a hint of
privacy, and it seems to be fairly comfortable - for a bargain-rate bedroom.

Those who stay here have money, though no titles.  The bed is a comfortable
creation of down and straw, and has several layers of soft blankets.  The

The bed is comfortable, but not so comfortable as to make you desire to

The rug is beautiful, woven with intricate skill by loving hands.  The

rear pouch of a merchant.

Every luxury is within this room.  The coloring is in regal hues of deep

light wood, trimmed and decorated with the same hue of deep purple, and some
gold leaf.  The chandelier that brightens the room sends patterns to
interlock with the filigree on the posts of the canopy bed, and the rope
that dangles beside that bed is decorated with a gold thread.  Everything
you see in this room bespeaks of great wealth and pampering.

Tools hang exactly where they should be, in crisp, logical order.  Started
experiments are shelved with tags that read such things as "Music Box" and
"Bell of Alarm" and "Cooling Device."  Jorinth obviously is a tinker in

Inside Elbwyth's Tower, Ground Floor~
Around and around the stones go from the base of this magnificent tower
upwards in a spiral.  Above you is a glimmer of light that sometimes fades
out for brief moments.  The soft sound of puttering feet and the stale scent
of old parchments seem to cling to the air itself.  The stones around the
base of the tower seem blackened and charred, for some odd reason.

HALT!
Move no farther! State your name and buisness. Look not about you, but at me.
Dare you pass upwards into the mages area? Well, fools, then you may pass.
Try not to leave too much of your blood on the walls for the apprentices.
They hate cleaning.

Second Floor - Apprentice Level~
This room is fraught with the remnants of failed magical experiments.  No
amount of scrubbing will remove the char-marks from the room.  Nothing will
clean up the green stains on the floor.  And that odd pile of dried-out
stringy stuff might have once been an octopus or a hydra.  One could never
tell, now.  To the north you see an open door, and several young students
practicing - often on each other.

Apprentice's Quarters~
Apprentices of all ages move about in this room, some with their noses in
books, some waving their arms about, and some resting.  A young girl wiggles
her nose and points at a young boy, which results in the boy's hair turning
green and standing on end.  This turns back on the girl when the boy squeaks
"COOL!"  In his changing voice, and shows off the new style.  The room
itself is nearly wrecked by the failed experiments seen in the hall outside
the door to the south.

Third Floor~
This is the hall of the Adept's Quarters and classroom.  Elbwyth's room
is to the east, the laboratory is to the north, and the classroom/practice
room is to the south.  The area here is in better repair, having recently
been scrubbed (probably by the newer apprentices.)  The lighting is good,
save for the occassional "dark" caused by something above you.  When you
look up, you see the heads of small dragonlets.  Some grin down at you.  You
begin to shudder, until you see one bump its nose on an invisible force. 
You're safe - you hope.

Long tables span the room lengthwise, some with bowls of water, many

bare.  Shelves hold jars with neat lables on them.  There are small
fire-pits in the walls at even intervals, with wood, water, and sand next to
them.  One table holds several scrolls weighted open by four small stones.

gasp and hold your hand over your mouth, worrying if the stench will cling

Quarters to the Adept, Elbwyth~
One would expect the private quarters of a mage so powerful as Elbwyth to
be lush and lavish, but this is not.  One would expect a mage as powerful as
Elbwyth to be ancient, but he is not.  One would expect a mage as powerful
as Elbwyth to be arrogant, cynical, and insulting as possible, but - well,
he is.  The room you look at is bare of decorations of any kind.  A simple
cot, desk, ad mirror are the only furniture.  Elbwyth sits at his desk
writing on a scroll.  When you enter, he stands to face you, and waits for
you to speak or attack.

Temple of Antyr - Grand Worship Hall~
The main hall of the temple is a great circular room with a dome on the
top.  A mural has been lovingly done on this dome, depicting six deities
(one which is a middle-aged woman) pulling portions of land from each other.
The artist's name is illegible, but you do catch the title of the mural as
being "The Great Rift."  Stairs take you up to some cubicles, and a chute
takes you down.  Exits lead into cubicles on the west, north, and south, and
back outside to the east.

This room drips with beauty and nature.  The donation bowl is really a
bunch of vines woven and interwoven, and roses decorate all the corners of
the room.  Ferns wave and create a gentle breeze, and you sense the feeling
of peace and life.  The nurturing found in the Goddess of Nature's cubicle of
worship leaves you no doubt as to why she's known as the "Mother of the
Gods."

that surround you, there rises a bright image of a flaming bird: The
Phoenix.  Around the edges of the cubicle are plants, various kinds of

them.  Also placed in the seeds are small notes, parchments, and pebbles
with writing on them.

You hear the sounds of the sea when you're standing in this cubicle, and
feel the winds blowing against your skin.  Shells are placed in strategic
places, alongside weapons of all sorts.  The donation pit is shaped as a
large golden sheath, and it's obvious thieves have tried (notice: Tried) to
take it before.  Legend has it that when the sheath of Romiere in Antyr
falls, she will die, and War will take over the lands.  It's unknown if the
Goddess kills the fools who try for it or if the people who catch them do,
but either way, it's never come down.

growling at any who enter, but allowing all to pass.  A single chair sits in
the corner of the room, with a pad in front of it.  A bowl rests next to the
pad, where donations are placed.  Donations tend to be literature, or poems.
It's been said that favored followers have knelt before the chair, and been
rewarded by seeing the black-haired deity appear in the chair to impart some
knowledge.

when she - er - he - er - whatever feels like it.  Which is often.  The
floor is lined with throw pillows and cushions (usually), and bath oils and
scents are scattered all around.  Shastromm doesn't take money as donations.
Nor do her clerks.  They prefer more - intimate pay.

In the darkness, a blind old woman spins on her wheel.  You think you see
little golden eyes peering around at the ground level, but you can't be

and the bed, which is a lumpy hay contraption, seems as if it might be home
for more than just the woman.  You'd lay bets on lice, bugs, and other
mites.  It makes you ill just looking at it.

Upon entering this luxuriously plush room, you get a great feeling of
welcome.  It seems every woman and man (yes, there are men working here)
trying to welcome you to the Parlor, to the food, to the drinks - to them. 
The Madame rests on an elegant love-chair, and behind her hangs a picture of
the most-loved Goddess of this establishment - Shastromm.  In fact, rumors
have it she's loved here often - but how much can you believe rumors? 
There's a waiting room to your south, and rooms to the north, east, and one
you reach by climbing up a gentle-sloping staircase in the back.

How does your lover rate?
1) When people describe you and your lover do they say you are:
   A) Joined at the hip
   B) So CUTE together
   C) Like oil and water
 
2) Does your lover lie when they say they didn't overspend?
 
3) Does your lover need batteries?
 
4) Does your lover ditch you for your brother or sister when you bring them home to meet the family?
 
5) Does your lover leave the chewing gum on the bedpost overnight?
 
Answers: 
1) If you answered A) give yourself 2 points. If you answered B) Give yourself 1 point. If you answered C) Tough luck! Time for a new lover!
 
2) If you answered "Yes" Give yourself a point. If you answered "No." Work harder at those guilt trips!
 
3) If you answered "Yes" It's DEFINITELY time for a new lover. If you answered "No" give yourself 1 point.
 
4) If you answered "Yes" It's too bad, that ain't your lover. If you answered "no" Be happy and give yourself 1 point.
 
5) If you answered "Yes" Ditch the lover, that's disgusting! If you answered "No" give yourself 1 point.
 
0 - 1 Why are you with this lover?
2- 3 It's an "OK" relationship, but your lover needs work.
4 - 5 Going strong! Lover rates well!
6 Now THAT's a passionate relationship!

Private "Guest" Room~
Lavish is the best way to describe this room.  In one part of it, you see
a soft table with warm towels lain out next to it.  Another part of the room
has a shelf with various spices and oils.  Incense is placed next to a
burner, and a few simple musical instruments rest on a table beside you.  A
rope with a tassle hangs by the soft table, and it makes you wonder what it
does.  When your curiousity gets the better of you, you tug it, and hear a
distant bell.  Soon after someone comes in with more warm towels, and
disappears as silently.

You step into this room and feel down.  Feathery-soft, the down is

those, hung by loops, are every type of feather imaginable from all around
the world.  Some you recognize, some you don't, but all, you would suspect,
would tickle you past the point of tears.  There are also stocks in here, to
put people while they're being tickled.  It's all-in-all an innocent, silly
way to pass the time, but there's no accounting for taste.  Or style,
either.

Forest of Rhythym~
You are entering the legendary Forest of Rhythym.  Within these woods it
is said the "Heart of Stone" is hidden.  This Heart is cherished as the
origin of all beat, all rhythym.  It's been carefully guarded since the
Rift, for fear that all Rhythym would end should it break.  This includes
the rhythym of breathing, heartbeats, and of walking.  Long ago, another
legend tells, there was a great fire in a city outside of Antyr.  This City
no longer exists, but the survivors, men known as "The Knights of Revels"
escaped.  Many fought when they discovered there was a ruse, and that it was
arson, save one.  That one retained his power long enough to find the Heart
of Stone - cracked.  In trying to fix it, he fell into a deep sleep.  That
Legend says the last Knight of Revels, Corwyn Tormyr, waits somewhere in
this forest for the next generation of heros to wake him, and help him heal
the forest.  All in all, though, the Forest seems a silent, spooky place.

Steab South Wharf~
You're standing on the rickety wharf, frightened it might give way. 
Attached to several poles are small rowboats, used to transport people to
and from the huge rigs out on the main ocean.

Shallow Waters~
These waters are deep enough for the small boats, but shallow enough for
the water to be light.  Small sea critters sometimes get stuck here, but are
soon fished out and either cooked up, or returned to deeper waters.

The Courtyard~
This courtyard is made of close-fitting stones which have been smoothed
and cleaned to a brilliant white.  Several trees line the courtyard, some
recognizable, some not.  One tree possesses a golden-hued trunk, and leaves
that you'd swear were carved of emeralds.  This tree stands to the west,
leading towards Tethyr Pass.  To your north, you see the Purple Elf Tavern
and Inn, but oddly, you hear no sounds coming from the building.  To your
east, you hear the sounds of the ocean in the distance.

Thentyr Pass~
Thentyr Pass is the mirror image of Antyr Way, but it leads away from the
ocean, not towards it.  In the distance to the west you can see a huge
building that winds up to the sky, though it's not a tower.
