Queen Elenda is relaxing upon her throne.
~
Queen Elenda, once a haughty and power-hungry woman, has now mellowed quite
a bit and cares for the welfare of Yrarl.  She knows she cannot ever truly
win the love of her husband Bollo, and their marriage was one of
convenience, a condition set by the Elders of the Council for Bollo to take
the throne.  She dotes upon her daughter, Princess Meryl, and hopes that one
day she will make a fine queen.

least twice as thick as in the original pawn shop, but since nobody else

The Entrance to Castle Yrarl~
You are standing before the large doors that lead into the Castle
Yrarl.  The castle looks forebodingly huge from here, almost more a
fortress than a castle, although the current King has made steps towards
renovating it so that it appears more friendly.  The massive stone blocks
that make up this castle look impossibly heavy and solid and you can only
marvel at the engineering of labor that constructing this castle must have
taken.  Hanging vines soften the harsh castle walls, and if one arrives
early enough, they are able to see the beautiful morning glories that bloom.

artistic eye than with a lavish eye.  There are no overt displays of wealth
here, yet the castle is furnished with tasteful and practical items.  The
elegant aqua carpeting offsets the stunning dark blue silk curtains that drape
about the windows.  A few torches peek out from bronze planters,

fireplace filled with perfumed wood is in the center of the room.  There
