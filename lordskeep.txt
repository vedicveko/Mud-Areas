*Lord's Keep
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This is the ancestral home of the Lord of Jareth, who has governed the City
of Freedom since the days when Jareth was but a vision in the first Lord's
head.  Since then, a new Lord has always ascended to the position which keeps
Jareth profitable and free, in Lord's Keep.

This zone has a small quest written into it - the Lord's daughter, Penelope
was abducted by Mordecai (another zone available) and now the Lord weeps in
mourning for his beloved daughter.  Save the daughter from Mordecai and bring
her back in one piece to her father, get a large pile of gold.

There is some mid- to upper-level eq and mobs here, as well as some fun
areas to explore.  This zone is meant to connect to Jareth.
