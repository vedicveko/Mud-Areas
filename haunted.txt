*Haunted Mansion
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This is part of a five zone package, a Haunted Mansion nestled deep in the
Dark and Sinister Forest.  There are ghosts and spectres, rats and spiders,
a cellar and an upper level, a ballroom and a study.  That sort of thing.
This is a zone geared toward experience gain - the objs are minimal, in fact
I do not believe I even included the objs file since there really wasn't
anything to offer, just a two junk eqs.  The exp for the mobs is jacked up
to compensate for the lack of eq, as well as the gold the mobs carry.
