A travelling vagabond~
A vagabond is hanging around here, trying not to look out of place.
~
You see a well-travelled man carefully examining the sky and the ground. You
wonder if he has something to hide as he turns to look at you and winces almost
unnoticeably. He is wearing a grey tunic and a pair of sandals and holds a
traveller's staff in his left hand. His eyes dart towards the temple quickly
as the wyrm on the roof moves its powerful body producing a scraping sound.
You feel that one wrong move could set him scaling over the walls and running
head over heels into the vast wilderness.

A Draconian Trooper wanders here, scouting the premises.
~
A living specimen of the legendary fearsome draconians, the trooper is well
built, almost gigantic humanoid lizard towering above you and all the 'normal'
people around the yard. It is here on an assignment to protect the delegate
from the draconians who has a meeting with the Daughter. It is walking around
the yard, determining the vital strategic information of the place and checking
out the people who walk here, trying to uncover assassins and other 
individuals who might provide a threat to its lord.

A Draconian Trooper is here guarding the life of its lord.
~
The reptilian trooper is here to protect his lord from harm. Its skin is
covered with steely green scales eliminating the need for any kind of 
additional armor whatsoever. It is unarmed but judging from the look of his 
clawed hands and muscular arms he doesn't need any arms other than his natural
ones. He towers above you, his head reaching up to 8'. Its teeth look sharp
enough to shatter bones and its yellow eyes look at everything and nothing at
the same time. You feel a little uneasy when he turns toward you to determine
your potential threat to his liege.

The Draconian Lord stands here, waiting to speak to the Daughter.
~
The mighty elder draconian is a delegate from the draconian high council, his
mission to discuss urgent matters with the Daughter of the Sun. His stature
is overpowering, his great dragon wings adding to the mighty aura of this
beautiful being. He, unlike the other draconians, wears clothing, even if it
is only a simple red jacket and a short red kilt-like skirt. The scales that
cover his skin are deep-green and perfectly polished. His tail is coiled around
his right leg as is the custom when appearing among other species. He looks at
you briefly before turning his eyes away from you without expression.

He smiles pleasantly and greets you by raising his hand. After seeing your

What would a temple be without priests? The man standing here is one of those 
who have been accepted by the Daughter to perform the daily priestly rituals 
and to provide clerical assistance to those who seek it here. He smiles at you
and makes a silent inquisitive gesture to let you know he's available should
you be in need of clerical services or just a person to talk to. He wears a
pair of sandals and the pale yellow tunic as a symbol of his priesthood in the

golden-bladed halberd. Despite the elaborate looks of his arms and armor you 
are certain they can be used properly to protect the temple from intruders if 
the need arises. Now he's smiling warmly at you though as it is part of his
job to make all visitors and pilgrims alike feel safe and comfortable inside

The high leader of the Temple, the Daughter of the Sun is a surprisingly small
woman, standing only at about 5' tall. Her golden hair lays on her shoulders
and her golden robe is stainless. She is sitting cross-legged on top of the
pillar facing the wyrm on the roof, talking with it in an arcane tongue. She
projects an aura of serenity and calmness all over the temple from her central
position. She glows with an inner light of holiness, drawing power directly
from the Sun. She doesn't notice you or is ignoring you totally.

The mighty golden wyrm nestles on the roof, surrounding the trapdoor where you
just climbed up. Its tail sways in the air lazily and its huge claws scratch
the roof making a tearing sound and leaving deep gashes in the pure white 
marble. Its head is facing north towards the pillar which reaches up just high
enough for a person on top of it to talk to the dragon face to face. Its
flawless golden scales reflect and enhance sunlight making it look like the
dragon in essence was the sun itself. Suddenly it turns its head towards you
and glares right into your soul with its yellow glowing eyes making you wish
you never opened that trapdoor in the first place. Maybe you should have asked
for an audience first..

You see a tiny little elf only about 4 feet tall. She is wearing a brown dress
with a black leather belt. Her hair is neatly cut and hangs on her shoulders 
partly covering her face. She would have a pretty face if not for the most
demonic grin ever seen on the face of a mortal being. Her green eyes seem to
register everything with a mere glance. She moves among the people with grace
and stealth, taking great care to avoid anyone getting suspicious as she
practices her profession.

{WApproaching the Temple Grounds{w~
You are standing in front of a gateway through massive fortifications. 
The guards on both sides of the gate smile at you benevolently and welcome
you to the Temple of the Sun.  Looking through the passage you see the
sacred yard bathing in sunlight which seems more intense over there.  On the
other side of the yard you can see the temple itself but you can't work out
exact details because of the numerous passers-by as well as the vapour
rising from the earth under the scorching sun.

You are walking through the massive walls that separate the temple
grounds from the surrounding wilderness.  Judging from the length of the
tunnel there must be rooms built into the walls, nobody would build walls 30
feet thick, would they?  Maybe the builders had a special reason to do so,
you'll never know for those who were witnessing the construction of this
magnificent temple have long since died, their bodies crumbled to dust.  You
see several pilgrims and wanderers who have set up camp on the sacred yard,
amongst them a group of draconians that catches the eye because of their
great stature.

campfire.  The sun above burns so hot you wonder if you need a campfire to
cook in the first place.  A couple of warriors are standing on guard up in
the tower, seemingly unaffected by the searing heat.  There are a few
travelling salesmen who have opened their wagons and are standing in the
shade selling their goods.

for the sun's glare on the yard here is unbearable.  A family of desert
lizards is living under a small bush that grows against the wall, you see
them quickly retreat in their hideout as you approach.  The bush is just a
normal everyday poison spike bush so you decide against closer inspection.

flag is flying high above the fortification, announcing the presence of this
asylum to all travellers within several miles.  Several travellers are
taking advantage of the sacred yard to make their camp for the night or even
longer if they so choose for the temple's rules allow anyone to make camp at
the sacred yard for as long as they choose, provided they don't cause
trouble.  The sun glares down at you fiercely and you see no sign of clouds
in the sky.  It's going to be a hot day.

of them are sitting out in the burning sunlight meditating with their eyes
closed.  You wonder how they are able to stand the solar fury that is
beaming down in a merciless fashion, day after day for the sun always shines
in the Temple.  It might very well be that they employ magical means of
protection..  Or then the Sun doesn't harm its faithful followers, you never
know about these cults.  In any case you are beginning to feel slightly
uncomfortable in the heat, better move on.

a few caskets and kettles spread out as visible as humanely possible. 
Various liquid- filled bottles produce brilliant little rainbows as the
sunlight shines through them, adding a touch of oriental mysticism to the
area.  You find a shady spot and rest yourself there for a while, glad to be

a humongous tent.  They are obviously bodyguards of the huge draconian noble
standing outside watching them work.  Seeing you approach they consider you
without the slightest hint of emotion.  After one minute of complete silence
they turn away again and resume their work.  Only the noble still looks at
you, without expression.  Seems like he's waiting for you to announce your
reasons for approaching.

here and there, adding to the forsaken look of the yard.  The heat is
constantly becoming more and more unbearable and looking at the sky you can
guess the sun is not finished yet.  No clouds.  You wonder if it's ever
going to set and let the wind cool off the yard.  You lean against the wall
for a moment to take a breather.  The heat is rapidly draining your

The sun doesn't shine here but the air is still quite hot.  Not as
uncomfortable as out there under the glare though.  Might as well stay a
while and rest, what's the rush anyway.  The stone wall feels cool to the
touch and you make the most of it.  Several broken bottles and other
unidentifiable garbage are spread all over the sandy ground, making it
hazardous to walk about without some kind of shoes or boots.  Who knows what
poisons were in those bottles.

now, it moved!  It's a live dragon, right there on the roof!  You can only
see the tail slowly waving in the air though.  You ask a pilgrim about the
dragon and she says: 'That is {YSolaris{x, the Protector of the Sun.  He's been

if you might provide work for a second before dismissing the possibility and
returning to their work, fixing their equipment, setting up bedrolls and
making food.  They seem to work pretty well as a team despite the lack of an
apparent leader.  They must have been through a lot together.

This is the northernmost part of the yard. The golden coloured stone wall is
burning hot as is the sand. You see a couple of vultures circling high in the
sky, just waiting for an unfortunate soul to provide them lunch. You doubt
they'll land on the yard to have their meal though because some of the people
you see here seem to be starving themselves. They'd probably be more than happy
to have cooked vulture for lunch undoubtedly. A group of pilgrims is walking by
quietly mumbling prayers to themselves.

little more heat.  You lean against the temple's wall and immediately pull
away as the searing hot stone burns your skin through your clothes.  You see
the entrance to the temple due east, maybe you can find a cool shade there.

{WAt the Door to the Temple{w~
You made it across the desertlike yard to the temple!  Just a few more
steps and you'll be safely inside and away from the deadly glare of the sun.
The guards at the door salute you as you take a quick look at the yard from
the door and try to decide where you want to go next.  You can see a bunch
of people east of here, there must be something interesting going on.  Think
carefully now, do you want to go see what it is and stand the sun for some
more time or just walk inside and out of the heat?

{WThe Sacred Yard, Northeast Segment{w~
The northeastern part of the yard is where the well is located. Lots of people
are standing here in line waiting with their buckets and cups for their turn to
refill their water supplies. You notice someone's cat has escaped and is 
dashing between the legs of people, desperately trying to avoid being trampled
by the thirsty masses of wanderers. You move forward to save the poor creature
but stop quickly as you notice a strong reptilian arm belonging to a large
draconian trooper picking it up and striding away towards their encampment in
the central part of the yard.

{WJust Inside the Temple{w~
You have stepped out of the burning sun into the surprisingly cool halls
of the Temple.  The vestibule is decorated with several fabulous and
colourful tapestries and the on the ceiling you see an artistic picture of
the Sun and its protectors, the mighty golden dragons.  The lighting is
smooth and pleasant.  A couple of errants are presently removing the dust
and sand from the floor with brooms and shovels.

{WA Small Prayer Room{w~
This small room contains only a little altar with a holy symbol on top of
it.  The floor is padded and there is a small openable window on the western
wall, probably to allow ventilation during the nights since the air can get
pretty hot during the days.  The altar is made of clear white stone and on
top of it, on a yellow, softly glowing piece of cloth is the holy symbol of
the Sun which is basically a rune-covered spherical golden ball on a simple
wooden pedestal.

This is the central hall of the first floor.  Due north you can see a
wide staircase going upwards to the second floor.  A door leads to a small
room to the south and to the north.  These rooms are used for people who
want to pray in peace, just them and their god.  The walls are adorned with
colourful frescoes depicting ancient battles between ancient enemies, the
followers of the Sun and the cult of the Moon.  The floor is made of golden
coloured tiles and massive white marble pillars support the ceiling in the
corners.

This is a small prayer room, designed to provide sufficient privacy and
room for one person at a time.  There is a small, openable window on the
east wall in case there is a need for ventilation.  On top of a small altar
on a yellow cloth is the Holy symbol of the Sun, a small, rune-covered
golden sphere set on a simple wooden pedestal.

You are standing at the base of the staircase which leads to the second
floor.  The stairs are made of yellowish white marble which emits a soft,
almost unnoticeable glow.  On the walls the frescoes continue upwards with
two massive battlefield scenes.  You sense a flow of warm air rushing down
from the second floor.  Other than that, it is surprisingly cool inside,
remembering how unbearably hot it was in the yard outside the temple doors.

{WAlong the Walkway{w~
The walkway takes a rounded turn northwards.  There are couches set
against the western wall and a few people are sitting in them, discussing
some matters in a low tone in order not to disturb those who want to
meditate or pray.  You can hear an occasional scraping sound from the
ceiling, just as if something was trying to dig in the ceiling.  Some
members of the Temple's priests walk around here slowly, offering their
assistance.

{WThe Walkway Along the Southern Wall{w~
A soft carpet under your feet efficiently kills the sound of footsteps as you
walk slowly, admiring the wonderful oriental tapestries and the fabulous
wall-paintings along the walkway. There is a simple door to the north leading
to the defender's quarters. Some people are sitting on the floor here, lost in
deep meditation. They seem totally unaware of their surroundings. You decide to
leave them alone for there is no reason to disturb them.

Having ascended the stairs up to the second floor you take a brief
overview of the things you see.  The floor is totally covered with a soft
carpet, effectively killing the sound of footsteps.  On the walls several
colourful tapestries create an oriental atmosphere and making the temple
feel more like an art gallery.  An occasional scraping sound can be heard
from the roof.  You wonder what's going on up there.

{WThe Walkway Along the Southern Wall{w~
A group of red-robed pilgrims have occupied this section of the temple,
their chanting makes you feel relaxed.  You watch their ritual for a moment
before quietly moving on, careful not to disturb them.  Some clergymen,
clearly of the temple's priestly order stand by here, humming along the
melody of the chant.  A door north on the north wall leads to the defender's
quarters and there is a stairway down due west.

{WThe Walkway Turns North{w~
A sweet smell attracts your attention.  Someone is probably burning some
incense in honor of the Sun.  Or has been since you can't see anything
burning anywhere A couple of empty couches have been set along the walls and
there is an open window high up the southern wall, apparently in order to
dissipate the smoke.  You feel tranquil, almost as if time had stopped and
you could live here in peace forever..  Must be the smoke getting to you. 
Better move along quickly before you pass out.

{WWestern Walkway{w~
You are walking towards the sun-lit balcony to the north.  A warm breeze
blows from the open corridor to the north.  The designers of this place have
clearly forgotten the possibility of rain.  Or maybe they haven't..  You
never know about these cults.  It just might be possible that it never rains
here..  Well no way to know that now.  Suddenly you see a huge tail waving
in the air above the balcony!  Whatever that belongs to must be on the
roof..  You are starting to have second thoughts about stepping outside and
in the reach of that creature.

{WThe Defender's Quarters{w~
These are the quarters of one of the temple's defenders.  It is simple,
with just a bed, a table, a chair and one shelf with several books on it. 
The man in sitting in the chair puts his book down and turns to look at you
with a smile on his face.  He is unarmored but has a longsword on his side. 
He doesn't seem bothered by your presence in his private room.  To the east
you see a door which leads to the paladin's room according to the man.  He
is not to be disturbed except in an emergency.

{WThe Paladin's Room{w~
The temple's high guard leader, the Paladin of the Sun lives here.  The
room is pleasantly decorated with several transparent silk scarves that
reach down to the floor.  You feel almost as if you were swimming in silk,
it feels unreal, as if it all was a dream.  Suddenly you come to the center
of the room.  There is a round area about 10 feet accross where there are no
scarves.  At the center stands the paladin, fully armored and armed, smiling
at you.  Above his head is a trapdoor leading to the roof.  His smile slowly
fades into an inquisitive look, maybe you should start explaining why you
have disturbed his meditation.

Here lives one of the temple's guards, the defenders.  He was laying on
the bed, relaxing.  When he saw you he clambered on his feet and greets you
by raising his hand.  He walks over to a round table in the center of the
room and lights a yellow candle on it.  With a wave of his hand he asks you
to sit down with him and to share your worries with him.  On the western
wall there is a door leading to the paladin's room.

The walkway suddenly ends and the balcony begins.  The sun shines
pleasantly down on you..  But the shine is not searing like it was on the
yard, now it is just warm and relaxing.  You are starting to believe there
really is a deity that is the sun..  Or is it the sun that is a deity.  You
decide to leave that to the philosophers to debate over.  The carpet ends
also, the golden plated floor continues northwards.

There is no railing to prevent you from falling off the balcony.  Looking
down you can see the drop is not that big, only about 20 feet down to a flat
sandy surface.  You don't feel like jumping off anyway, the sand might not
be that soft.  The sun shines down pleasantly, unlike on the yard where it
was trying to fry you down to ashes.

{WThe Sun-Lit Balcony{w~
The balcony continues to the west where it goes inside the temple's
halls.  A warm breeze blows from the east, creating a pleasant, lazy
atmosphere.  To the east you see a white marble pillar which reaches up
approximately 20 feet, just enough to be level with the roof of the temple. 
Looking up you see a massive reptilian head connected to an equally massive
reptilian body on the roof.  It seems to be talking in a low voice to
someone or something on top of the pillar.  You can't see anything or anyone
there though.  Maybe you could investigate.  If you arent afraid of dragons
that is..

The white pillar stands here, reaching the sky.  On the northern side of
it you see a series of iron bars fitted in to allow climbing up to the top
should anyone so desire for one reason or another.  The wyrm seems to focus
all its attention to the top, obviously someone or something is there.  You
are glad it hasn't noticed you..  Or if it has it's not paying any attention
to your presence on the balcony.  Two priests walk out here, talking in a
low voice.

The balcony turns westwards toward a tall pillar standing in the middle
of it.  Looking up you can see a surprising sight, a masive dragon's head
looming over the pillar.  Its jaws move as if talking but you are unable to
hear a sound other than the soft whisper of the wind.  Looking around you
can see the endless wilderness behind the huge fortifications protecting the
temple from marauders and preventing wild animals from wandering into the
sacred yard.

{WOn the Roof of the Temple{w~
You have climbed through the trapdoor and onto the roof.  Taking a brief
look around you see mountains of golden scales all over you.  A huge golden
wyrm nestles comfortably on the roof, completely surrounding you with its
massive body, its tail waving high in the air above your head.  You can see
the blue sky above you, the sun's rays beaming down and reflecting from the
wyrm's scales creating a fabulous lightshow right in front of your eyes. 
You feel at peace despite the fact that the wyrm could crush you with the
slightest move of its tail.

You have climbed up on top of the Pillar of Flames, the focus of the Sun
on the earth.  The glare is utterly unbearable, the heat approaching 100
degrees celsius.  This is the point to talk to the Sun if there ever was
one.  This is also the private place of meditation of the Daughter of the
Sun, the sovereign leader of the Temple.  You are beginning to have real
problems with the heat, the sun seems more determined than ever to melt you
down to a puddle.  Better get your business done and get out of here.
