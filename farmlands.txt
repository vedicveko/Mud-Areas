*Farmlands of Jareth
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This zone was made as a connector to other zones, a basic filler zone full
of low level mobs and eq.  DragonSpyre, the Corn Maize, the Sinister Forest,
Jher, and Ofingia all connect off this zone on Dibrova.  It is not a
particularly stand-out zone, but is a decent enough connector zone.
