This mountain hermit has been secluded from any intelligent society so
long that he has lost any concept of coherent speech.  Instead he cackles at
you, making strange clicks with his tongue, mingled with hoots and imitations 
of birdcalls.  He is dressed in grimy rags, obviously in need of repair, and 
smells as if he hasn't had a bath in ages.

Entrance to the Valley of Dawn~
You stand before the entrance to a large valley, covered with mist and
low grayish clouds heavy with moisture.  There are large strange trees here,
burdened with massive leaves easily man-sized.  As you gaze about, you
notice the valley sprawls before you to the north while the way back lays
south.

Inside the Valley of Dawn~
You are in the Valley of Dawn.  All about you strange vegetation grows of
a type you have never seen.  A carpet of lush purplish grass covers the
ground, and the low fog that hangs in this valley is rather light here.  You
feel rather peaceful here, listening to the sounds of birds chirping and the
mourning and lonely caw of a bluejay flying around you.  You can see a lake
to the north.

breathtaking as the clear water spans your entire vision before you.  The
reflection of the sky upon the calm water and the deep woods that surround

only smile at its splendor.

The Southeast Shore of Haven Lake~
You are on the southeast shore of Haven Lake.  The water laps gently
against the rocks and dirt, its rythmic sounds relaxing you.  The clouds in
the sky part slowly, their mellow misty edges letting in the light.  A
melody of woodland sounds emanates from the forest about you, adding to the
sound of the gentle waves to produce a soft symphony of light music.

as the shades of the nearby forest overcast the sunlight that reflects of
the lake.  A few ducks quack merrily at you from their hiding place amound
the reeds and rocks.  A cool breeze blows softly against your skin and a
small dragonfly buzzes up against your ear.

and you can smell the faint scent of jasmine in the air.  You start to feel

You have reached the far west short of Haven Lake.  This area is shrouded
by the trees of the forest which grow nearby, encasing the waterfront in
light shade.  A virtual crowd of reeds grows in the water nearby here,
obstructing your view of the magnificent lake.

that spills from higher up, perhaps from the snowcaps that cover the
mountain, which you are at the base of.  Around the pool is a thich carpet
of greenery, spotted by random flowers and a few sparse trees.  In this
secluded spot, you feel a bond with the forces of nature which surround you.

life around here, as the tracks and spoor left by various animals are
scattered about, visible to the trained eye.  A small trail of hooves leads
up the mountain from here.

type.  As you look about, enjoying the crisp mountain air, you notice that a
fall at the point would most likely result in death.  You grimly clutch the
mountain face tighter.

Entrance to the Grand Hut~
You are standing before a thatched hut easily the size of three of the
other ruglar huts in this village.  Outside of the hut there are strange
ritualistic markings painted with colored mud upon the walls of this
edifice.  A few strange totems and assorted marked amulets have been placed
around the house, marking it as the living quarters of a shaman or chief.

Inside the Grand Hut~
You are inside the largest hut in this village.  It is rather dark in
here, but a strange greenish fire burns brightly in the center of the room.
Various animal bones and skins have been scattered about and the smell of
decaying flesh is strong here.  A large spear made from wood and tipped with
obisidian is hanging upon the wall and strange paintings of rituals have
been hung everywhere.

The Back Room of the Grand Hut~
You are inside the Grand Hut of the Frogmen.  This room is furnished
well, with a large sponge bed and leaf sheets.  A rough table has been made
and stands in the center of this room, and a few clay mugs sit on it.  A
large rug made from fish skins covers the mud floor and utensils made from
bone are neatly stacked on a bark shelf in the corner.
