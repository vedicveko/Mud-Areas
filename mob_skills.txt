WHAT IS THIS?

Functions to give mobiles the ability to use skills.

INSTALLING

Just stick mob_skills.c in your src directory and edit your Makefile to
get it to compile. I also stuck the functions in utils.h because I'm lazy.

Dibrova has a sweet skill system courtesy of Rodger so in order to get this to
work you'll probably have to strip the ABT_SKILL part off of all of the damage
functions.

You could also setup a little case statement in the perform_violence function
and have it switch between the various NPC classes calling skill and spell
functions along the way. (See the NPC Giant Crap snippet on my site.)

DISTRIBUTING/CHANGING

Do what ever you want, just please put my name in your builder credits file
so I have something to stroke my ego with. Also, a nice email saying you use
my stuff would be nice.

I also got the idea for this off a Winter Mute snippet.
They have some really cool stuff at http://mute.starweb.net
