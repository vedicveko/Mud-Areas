#HELPS
The Prison is where the vilest of criminals of the realms are housed.  On
the outside, it looks like a normal prison, but truthfully on the inside,
it is one of the worst run places ever.  Prisoners are tortured, then
left to rot in their own blood.  It is said that some have escaped, but
the official word on that subject is "No way".
This is a no recall area, be careful.

The Prison was written by Alecca for Devil's Silence MUD
(ds.ruinsmud.com:5000).  It is being used with the understanding
that the area will remain relatively intact and that the help file shall
not change, only changes to hp/weapon dice/armor class and the like are 
allowed.  Names and descriptions will not change.

Path to the Prison~
The prison looms ahead.  The grounds are massive, and there
are no trees and the shrubbery is kept low so that the 
guards can maintain a good view of the prisoners.  It is a
very bleak place, a place of punishment.

A room in the Administration Building~
This is a room where the guards come to chill out and relax, or calm
down.  Being a guard in this prison is very stressful.  There are barely
covered up holes in the walls, probably from an upset guard trying to vent
frustration.  Other than that, there is not much special about this room.

A secret prison!~
You are in a secret prison cell, where the warden keeps his "play toys". 
Elinthia seems to be the flavor of the month.  When he tires of her, he'll
find another helpless prisoner to fulfill his sick desires.  The room reeks
of sex, which normally isn't a bad thing, but this is degrading sex.... 
What a shame they put people in power who take advantage of others.

The Recreation Yard~
The recreation yards loom on for miles.  Prisoners can get
all the exercise they need here.  A long track circles the 
yard.  It is so large, that many get confused as to where 
they are.

The Prison Gardens~
You are standing in the prison's gardens.  Neat rows of vegetables and
flowers surround you.  They must be pretty self efficient here, but the
better the food they make, the better the food they eat.

The Beggining of an escape tunnel~
Fresh dirt is everywhere...  It is evident that this is one of the newest
attempts at escape from this hell of a prison.  The escapees haven't gotten
very far in their attempt tho....  Perhaps they will manage to finish their
tunnel before the guards catch them, but most likely not.

A Dark Tunnel~
Can it be? YES! An escape route! From this tunnel emanates the sweet smell 
of green grass and fresh air. You can clamber through and escape, though
the tunnel is so narrow you doubt you'd be able to return through it.
