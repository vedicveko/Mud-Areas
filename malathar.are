you.

bow...

the time to grant you some of his knowledge.

The Platinum Dragon~
The Platinum Dragon known as Haan, ally and friend of the Duke, sleeps here.
~
The mighty Haan served as the Duke's steed during the Goblin Wars many
centuries ago, but is now way past his prime, and he spends most of his
time sleeping and dreaming of past glories. For, long-lived as Wyrms are,
Elves are much longer-lived, being virtually immortal, and it saddens both
Haan and his master that their days together are now numbered.

for the rest of his days. This the Elf gladly did, for he was of pure heart
and fair courage, and he has kept his vow ever since.

~
Grein is a crusty old veteran of the Goblin Wars, an Elven foot soldier of
low caste who, like so many of his fellow lesser Elves, fought valiantly for

played in their salvation. Nevertheless, Grein has managed to make a healthy
profit in his armory, and, along with his brother Tolos, is one of the most
respected dealers in items of war in the whole nation.

prices for your weapons.

The Elves as a whole dislike and distrust Dwarves, and the only reason that
Keruggan is allowed to run a business is that he is also the ambassador
to Malathar from Juargen. He has very few customers, as Elves consider
Dwarven skills crude and vulgar, and as such will do his best to try and
encourage any he gets to return.

Dryads are a respected and feared race in Elven lands, respected for their
knowledge of all things natural and feared for their forbidding size and
appearance (seven foot tall humanoids clad in flowing brown robes that
conceal their features). None of this bothers Moredhein, as he a dryad he 
is above succumbing to the false emotions generated by flattery, and as a
mere mortal he finds the Elves' fear amusing.

The Plains of Malathar~
You have emerged from the dark forest on the plains of the Elven Duchy
of Malathar, ruled by the good Duke Stalatharata, under the guidance and
watchful presence of his God and Mentor, the Elven Immortal Yaegar. Tall 
spires rise in the distance, emerging from the magnificent Elven city of 
Malathar, to which the path you are upon leads.

There is a small, hand-lettered sign near the path...

The Road to Malathar~
You are moving along a broad, well-formed path that is bordered by neatly-
groomed trees and hedges. To the north you can hear what sounds like a horse
braying, while to the east the city of Malathar looms larger.

You have entered the sanctum of the Unicorns of of Malathar, close friends
and allies of the Elves of Malathar. However, despite their benevolent
nature, the Unicorns dislike intruders, especially armed and aggressive ones,
and will not hesitate to use extreme force to evict these intruders. In
addition, to protect these creatures, the Elven sorceror Tuo has placed
powerful enchantments on this place that prevent magical attacks on the
unicorns.

at you as you pass. The gates of the city are now visible, as are the guards
stationed near them, their colorful rainments dazzling you even from this

monument erected, dedicated to the many Elven Lords who died during the 
ferocious Goblin Wars that devastated most of the Elven Nations. The statue 
shows a band of Elves courageously defending an unarmed woman and her child 
from a band of hideous Goblins, and is quite brilliantly fashioned. There is

You may proceed west to the Gates, or east towards a second tower, or enter
the tower you stand beneath. You fancy you can hear a faint screeching 
coming from this tower...

There is a hand-written note pinned to a noticeboard nearby.

It is here that the young Elves who wish to become Elite Scouts live and

tracking or fighting Goblin raiders. The few that are here are those that
were not fit or worthy enough to take to the field this season.

This is the Headquarters of the City Guard. It is from here that they
co-ordinate their efforts to keep the peace in the streets of Malathar,
handling mostly cases of petty crime (the Elite Guard handle serious 
problems). They frown on civilians entering their premises, but will
tolerate your presence for they will recognize you as a mere ignorant
foreigner who probably doesn't speak enough Elvish to understand when
they're being told to LEAVE.

rooms holds some burning herbs, which fill the room with an acrid smoke. An
elderly elf is busy fiddling with a rather strange contraption upon which he
places black plastic discs from which a rather odd sound emerges, along with
much scratching and hissing. He has quite a collection of these disks, which
are packaged in luridly-colored paper envelopes, replete with pictures of
rather weedy-looking, long-haired, pale-skinned humans (?).

The Stablemater's Room~
This room is scarcely different form the other stable rooms, save that it
contains a table and a chair for the stablemaster, a burly Half-Elf with 
tattoos and a tan.

The Stables~
You are walking through an open area littered with hay and the occasional
pile of steaming turds. Stablehads rush about, cleaning up these filthy 
messes.

The Captain's Quarters~
You have entered a well-furnished office which serves as the reception area
for the Captain of the Guard. He will chat with you here about your concerns
and try to give you advice, but will always remain on guard. He boasts to 
you of the fact that his office is a magical field, and that dimensional 
gateways occasionally appear here. Sounds like crap but you never know...

Sun Room~
You have entered the Palace's Sun Room, famous for his huge crystalline
windows specially crafted to capture and magnify the rays of the sun so that
the room is brilliantly lit at all hours of the day. A few easychairs and
cushions have been scattered across the floor here, and you see a couple of
Elven Nobles languidly relaxing in the warmth of the sun, sipping on fine
Elven wines.

The West Door~
You are standing at the West Door of the Palace, which faces onto Obeith
Street, which runs from the Palace to the Temple in the West. Guards mingle
about the doorway, casting the occasional suspicious glance in your 
direction. Massive stone statues of past Elven lords tower above you on all
sides.

The Moon Room~
This room appears to be identical to the Sun Room, save that the windows in
here are cunningly designed to capture and reflet moonlight so that even
on the darkest nights there is illumination. Nobles lounge around here, idly
singing old tunes or playing simple games of chance.

past the guilds towards the Library of Malathar. Nearby, you can see the
stone colossus of the Duke. Garlands of flowers have been arranged about the
South Door, in honor of some half-forgotten festival.

The Throne Room~
It is here that the Duke and his wife receive their subjects, seated upon
huge platinum thrones flanked by their Elite Guards. Occasionally Tuo the
Arch Mage or Lallinthenera the High Priest will attend, though both dislike
such officious business. Your footsteps echo about this pillared hall as
you tread slowly upon the marble floor. You can feel several pairs of eyes
on you as you travel, and suddenly find yourself eager to be gone from the
room as soon as possible.

past the various shops and places of business, towards the Gates of Malathar.
People stop and stare at you with open curiosity, and you quickly become
aware of your relatively scruffy appearance.

The Water Room~
The second you enter this room you begin to panic, as you suddenly think you
are far underwater! But you quickly compose yourself (trying to ignore the
amused stares cast in your direction), and realize that the room you are in
is in fact formed of sheets of glass behind which flows sea water complete 
with several species of marine life. The effect is unnerving, but quite 
beautiful. You have to concentrate hard to cross the room, and can't help 
but imagine you are truly walking on water...

The East Door~
You are standing at the East Door of the Palace, facing onto the western
end of Nollthala Street, which runs to the east to the stables and the Tower
of the Archmage. Several scouts mill about, their Cooshee pets left 
momentarily unattended, and you suddenly feel very much an alien in this
place.

ACK! You're Falling!





Wait...No you aren't. Unbelieveable as it is, the entire room has been
fashioned so as to appear to be open sky, with no walls, floors or celings.
People wander about, quite unfazed by the effect, and you feel a little
foolish as you clamber to your feet and attempt to get your bearings.

The Central Shelving Area~
You are in the Central Shelving Area, from which the librarians take the
many books being constantly borrowed, returned, bought and sold. You are
overawed by the sheer volume of books in this place, and gasp as you realize
that the shevles are at least seventy feet high and extend as far as you can
see...

The South Wing~
You are in the South Wing, where recent acquisitions (i.e, less than 500
years old) are stored. The pace down here is so frenetic, no one even
notices your presence, and you feel certain that you could pocket a couple
of tomes or librams and no-one would know...

This Wing is very dusty and, compared to the rest of the library, is
practically deserted. This is where out-of-date or obsolete texts are held,
and you see little that seems interesting. You are not surprised no-one
wants any books from this area.

may catch you (not that many of the Librarians would mind- its just less 
books they have to worry about...)

south, or investigate an interesting-looking dusty passage that slopes down
from here...
Alternatively, you could just return to the ground floor...

The Storage Areas (B2)~
You have reached B2, the dusty storage sub-level mentioned on the directory
on the ground floor. It looks as if no-one has been down here for centuries.
There seems to be little of interest here. However, you fancy that you
can hear snoring coming from somewhere...

now reaches your ears, shaking the very foundations you walk beneath...

Uh-Oh....You found out what was snoring...it is a DRAGON...a HUGE DRAGON,
coiled up in the massive cavern you just entered, its sinuous tail wrapped
about a massive treasure chest. The Dragon must be about eighty or ninety
feet long, you estimate, at least twice the length of any you've fought
before, and to top it off he is a Platinum Dragon, who are amongst the most
powerful of all Wyrmkin. Amazed that the Dragon hasn't reacted to your
presence yet, you pause and wonder what to to...
