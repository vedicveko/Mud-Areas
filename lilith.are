Lilith~
A tall, scantily clad women of impressive stature stands before you.
~
Known as the Slut of the Abyss, the succubus, the Demon Whore, and 
other pleasant names, Lilith is the eldest of all vampires, and by
far the most deadly. Purely evil, Lilith exists only to devour the flesh
and blood of mortal men. Women she takes as mates and slaves, making them
thralls of her powerful will.

guardian will not raise his weapon against those who approach; rather he will
seek to warn them of the certain death they will meet should they proceed.
Swathed in flowing black robes that conceal gleaming black chain, he stands
with his hands resting upon his greatsword.

This fell undead has been given the task of protecting the First Level, and
will attack any and all who attempt to proceed forward to the next level. While
it is ferocious and evil, it is not very perceptive, and should be easy to
slip past. It resembles nothing so much as a translucent warrior, bearing no
weapon save for its glowing hands, from which radiates a chill that is cold
enough to make you shiver at 10 yards.

Gloom~
A shimmering dark apparition hovers here.
~
Once a mage of considerable power, Gloom challenged Lilith to a battle,
and managed to fight her to a draw. However, the effort so taxed him that
he was reduced to a non corporeal entity, capable of great magic but no
longer able to exist normally on the Prime Material Plane. Thus he now
lurks here, invisible to Lilith, plotting revenge.

A Mist-Shrouded Lake~
Thick mist clouds your vision on all sides as you traverse the murky waters
of the lake. Strange howls and cries echo across the water, accompanied by
the occasional scream and gurgle of some unseen victim to the many predators
that infest these waters. You cannot perceive how deep these waters may be,
or what may lurk beneath the scum-coated surface. Twisted, gnarled trees,
their decayed limbs coated in thick growths of fungus, sprout at random
intervals from the lake, are frequent hazards, as you cannot seem them until
you are almost on top of them.

A Mist-Shrouded Lake~
Thick mist clouds your vision on all sides as you traverse the murky waters
of the lake. Strange howls and cries echo across the water, accompanied by
the occasional scream and gurgle of some unseen victim to the many predators
that infest these waters. You cannot perceive how deep these waters may be,
or what may lurk beneath the scum-coated surface. Twisted, gnarled trees,
their decayed limbs coated in thick growths of fungus, sprout at random
intervals from the lake, are frequent hazards, as you cannot seem them until
you are almost on top of them.

The Gates of the Castle~
Rising out of the murky waters here is a small island that boasts a
rusted iron gate, which leads into a looming structure to the west.
Despite its size, it is not visible from more than a few feet away,
being as its walls are covered in marsh muck and assorted other 
substances. It is not surprising that you found it hard to locate. The
gate doesn't appear to be locked; peering between the bars you see a 
long stone corridor beckoning...

Wet, slimy stone presses in all sides; you shiver as you pass through
the iron gate, and wince as it clangs shut suddenly behind you, the
noise echoing down the dank corridor. No torches illuminate the hall,
nor are there any signs of provision for such items. The floor is slick
underfoot, suggesting mold and other substances that grow in a place
that has most probably not felt the touch of sunlight in centuries, if
ever.

A Junction~
The damp corridor terminates here, at a junction, marked by several
decaying corpses staked to the slimy walls. Several more corpses, of
elves and goblins, sit skewered about a small unlit brazier at the
junction; the purpose of this is unclear, but you think it wisest not
to meddle. A strong odor wafts in from the northern corridor, while
a keeing wail echoes from the west. Neither sound nor noise can be
detected to the southwest, however, just dark, impenetrable dark, and
silence. Truly this is indeed a lair of Chaos, and you do not doubt that
whatever is the master of this domain will be a potent adversary indeed!

Rivers of Blood~
The walls of this section of corridor have been cunningly decorated to
give the impression that they are flowing rivers of blood, gushing in
torrents back and forth along the walls, like the cargo of some inhuman
vein of gargantuan proportions. A dull throbbing, pulsing sound, as of a
heart beat magnified in intensity a hundredfold, echoes back and forth
along the corridor. A chill wind blows in from the east, accompanied by
a fell howling; the resulting cacophony of sound is almost enough to send
you mad.

The Gates to the Court of Lilith~
As the heartbeat reaches a crescendo, it suddenly halts when you pass
before the gates to the west. Ornately crafted from platinum and onyx,
the unique combination of the two substances gives an impression of age
and grandeur, while the naked, writhing women carved into the frame preserve
Lilith's taste for decadence and wanton excess, especially in her chosen
gender. It is rumored that only a woman may pass safely before Lilith, and
that any man foolish enough to cross her path will be dealt with in 
unimaginable ways. No keyhole mars the gate, nor bar, yet it does not yield to
a gentle push or even a firm nudge.

save for the ever present slime that coats the surface everywhere. A 
slightly unpleasant odor wafts in from the south, snapping you back from

Something is not right here, even not counting the eerie silence. The smell

waste materials.

The corridor ends here, in a dead end. Surprised and mildly disappointed,
you allow yourself to pause for a moment and collect yourself. It is then
that the floor beneath your feet opens up, depositing ankle deep pools of
scummy water into a long deep shaft! You scramble for safety, hoping you
can avoid joining them in plummeting down to whatever horror the vile smells

downwards as you fall, you see a deep pool of water, in which various

You land with a splash in a neck deep pool of fetid black water. Almost
immediately you feel various creatures brushing against you, and you fight
down a rising wave of panic, in an attempt to work out what the hell to do
next. A thick wall of stone slides soundlessly into place above your head,
preventing return in that direction, and leaving you trapped in this horrible
chamber. More water is pouring in through a grate set in the east wall.

presumably it empties into the swamp outside.

while to the south you can hear nothing.

Piles of debris float past you on the scummy water, drifting with a

above ground source, causing a considerable stench to fill the place as
the debris is disturbed and releases various gasses, as of a dead animal
carcass when it is disturbed.

The End of the Sewer~
At this point water gushes in from the swamps above, pounding down on
the sewerage and driving it through some hidden grates below. The flow
is strong, and much of the water is forced southwards rather than being
able to escape down the tiny drain, thus keeping a decent volume of water
in the sewer so that the refuse may eventually be carried away. Unspeakable
horrors undoubtedly lurk below the grate, and you make no effort to 
investigate further.

Erosion at a gap in the bedrock beneath the marsh that the castle rests

this gaping hole, which several people could ascend travelling abreast.
The water slops over your head and face, but is not distracting enough

at times to disturb your balance. To the west, the tunnel disappears into

A wise man in your home town once said that "A prudent and clever soldier
will never venture into the heart of his enemies toilet facilities". At
the time you failed to grasp the meaning of his rhetoric, but now you
suddenly realize, as you stare in horror at the filthy chamber before you,
the source of his dire edict. Unfathomable odors arise from a gaping hole

creatures feasting on the encrusted remains scattered about this hole.

twisting corridor heads deep into the heart of the fortress. You are

anguish at the mercy of this vile stench.

Troll Barracks~
Lilith favors all manner of barbarous creatures as soldiers, guards and
thugs, but none are as impressive to her as the simple, but strong trolls.
Where the minotaurs have cunning and guile, and question orders frequently,
the trolls slavishly obey. Where the ogres and orcs may balk at vastly
superior numbers, the trolls will merely grunt and charge, without any fear.
Clad in rough black plate, and bearing vicious weapons in addition to their
fearsome natural armaments, the trolls are ideal shock troops. Their barracks
are surprisingly clean, since Lilith imposed a death sentence on any who failed
to use the latrines instead of their quarters for any and all waste disposal.
There is a strong odor in the air, however, of animal fur long left unbathed.
The barracks stretch to the north and south, while a stairwell lies to the
west.

Piles of dirty cloth fill the corners of the room, as well as most of
the middle, providing bedding for a half dozen trolls or more. There is
in addition provision for a small fire for heat in winter, though it never

The Dark Stairwell~
A set of greasy stone steps ascends to the next level of the keep here,
guarded by a rather large and singularly ugly troll, bearing even more
vicious implements of destruction. Every ship has its captain, and around
this section of the keep this troll is the master. While mere mention of 
Lilith's name can cause her minions to tremble in fear, it is nowhere near
as imposing as the mailed fist of the sergeant bearing down on them to 
enforce discipline. Lilith recognizes and encourages the ego of this fellow,
and likes to see him hold her troops in thrall.

Troll Barracks~
Piles of dirty cloth fill the corners of the room, as well as most of
the middle, providing bedding for a half dozen trolls or more. There is
in addition provision for a small fire for heat in winter, though it never
gives off more than a feeble glow as trolls loathe and fear the touch of
the naked flame, one of the few known ways to truly scar their resilient

A Cavernous Hall~
The stairs end in a feebly lit hall of gigantic proportions, which
stretches far to the west. The pillared walls are lined with gloomy
portraits of past rulers of the keep, all female of course, and all 
displaying obvious signs of their vampiric lineage. The ceiling far
above you bears murals depicting cannibalism, torture and human sacrifice
before the grinning visages of the gods of chaos. Every few seconds the
walls seem to shift slightly; a sure sign that they are composed of the
stuff of chaos, bound together by the will of the ruler of this fell domain.
The floor is slippery underfoot; gazing down you realize it is coated in
blood...

The End of the Hall~
Death. Destruction. Chaos. These are the themes of the images that
assault you as you enter this section of the hall. Faces appear in the
stonework, screaming soundlessly as they endure a nightmare of endless
agony, bound into the structure of Lilith's domain. Blood seeps from the
walls and floor, making travel difficult without slipping and crashing to
the floor. The sound of stone grating on stone echoes about here, as of
some monolithic guardian working its way towards you.

The court of Lilith is a surprisingly colorful affair, for a prominent
figure among the undead, boasting brightly colored banners hanging from
gilded beams set in the whitewashed ceiling. Giggling noblewomen, enticingly
clad, mingle about here, in the hopes of an audience with Lilith. Evidently
this area has been designed to impress and beguile them, obfuscating the
true nature of Lilith from those who foolishly seek her help and affection;
they will find only servitude and death. Several burly minotaurs prowl the
court, keeping a close eye on the proceedings in case anyone manages to
realize the fate that is in store for them. A massive set of banded metal
doors lies to the west, guarded at all times by Lilith's wyrm. Surely these
doors must lead into the haven of Lilith herself!

Upon closer inspection, you realize that the banded metal gates you

shimmering substance; the souls of those slain within the walls of

staring in horror outwards, beseeching you for help; help that you
cannot give. Only when all Chaos is removed from the universe will these
souls be freed.

The Keeper of Pernaglia~
A plain, white walled chamber lies here, dominated by a heavy metal
chair, upon which the sole occupant of this place spends most of his
time. Due to one of the many unpredictable variables that accompanies
any chaotic magic, Lilith is unable to enter this room, nor even to
look within here, even involuntarily. This causes her some small amount
of concern, for enemies of hers may find sanctum here, though she accepts
this as one of the many prices for the power that comes with serving Chaos.

A Choice of Perils~
Four dark stone corridors meet here, at this crossroads, marked by
a massive statue of polished obsidian. The construct- a massive, muscular
minotaur rending some indefinable humanoid in two- stands at good eleven
feet tall, reaching nearly to the arched ceiling, which is engulfed in
gloom. Shrieks and howls of pain echo in from the east, while to the
west you rather fancy you can hear a crowd cheering. No sound issues forth
from the north or south.

This foul chamber is a torture chamber, the same as dozens of other
torture chambers that you have been in during your long career. The
usual devices- rack, iron maiden, hot coals, pokers and whips- are
present, but so are several new, wicked implements; the purpose of each
is not clear to you at this time, which is perhaps fortunate. If you remain
long enough, you will undoubtedly see their function demonstrated by the
maniacs that staff this foul chamber. Several mangled corpses, hanging from
large meat hooks that dangle from the ceiling, occasionally swing in front
of you, causing you to duck reflexively and gag.

beast charging silently up and down through the corridor, but when the
image passes you shake your head and decide you must be seeing things.
Nothing that large could move so swiftly and soundlessly, surely? A
tingle of fear causes you to twitch involuntarily, and you wonder if 
proceeding in this direction is such a good idea...

wall you see an armored knight that was smashed with such force that his
body was imbedded in the stone wall. The corridor continues north, twisting
to the east in that direction. To the south a stairway offers escape from
this dreadful place.

weapons and armor litter the floor, the possessions of other adventurers,
escaped prisoners and even a few unfortunate guards of the keep that
strayed down here. Evidently the guardian that lurks here is not particular

outside of her sanctum? Or perhaps it will give you a chance to be

causing you to be soaked in sweat in a manner of seconds. Hordes of
cheering, screaming creatures of all races fill the stands, lustily
awaiting your demise. An illusion, undoubtedly, but an effective one,
and you find yourself impressed almost despite yourself by the power of
Lilith's magic; though you do find it curious that such a spectacle would
mean so much to her. Evidently even the Queen of Vampires desires the
thrill of a packed arena. Bounding across the sand towards you is a 
creature that is definitely quite real, and you grit your teeth and prepare
to do battle, all too aware that Lilith is somewhere nearby, very close
nearby, watching you...

dancers to some unheard music, lost in the macabre ritual they are engaging

enter your home town, only to see it ablaze from end to end, and swarming
with vile demons spawned from the pits of the Abyss. Frantically, you try
to leap back through the portal, but there is no sign of it. Drawing your
weapon, you turn to face the fiends, a grim smile on your lips as you 
realize you are facing your last battle. Within seconds it is over, the
horde leaping upon you and tearing you limb from limb.

The End~
The corridor, and its unsettling occupants, ends here, at two doors, one
set in the north wall and the other in the eastern wall. Cries and howls
of pain, accompanied by a high pitched sniggering, issue forth from behind
the door to the east, while nothing but silence comes from the north. A
severed tail, of some unknown beast, has been nailed to the northern door,
the dark ichor seeping from the severed end staining the blackened wood an
even darker shade.

Perdition~
This bare stone chamber is used to incarcerate lackeys of Lilith who
have displeased her in some way. They are always mutilated, a permanent
reminder of their transgression, and a severed appendage of the critter
is nailed to the door, to remind others. Trolls, being capable of
regenerating even whole limbs, aren't particularly impressed by this
punishment, so Lilith keeps an acid bath for the recalcitrant ones amongst
their number.

An Infernal Operating Theater~
The majority of this room has been scrubbed clean, the shining white
walls a paragon of cleanliness and hygiene. That is probably the only
commendable feature of what is by all other definitions a slaughter
house/torture chamber. Mutilated humanoids lie struggling feebly on
the iron tables they have been tied to, while a bony surgeon wanders
from one to the other, making a casual slice her or amputation there.
Their cries of pain are weak and soft, as most of them have had their
mouths sewn shut and their tongues cut out. Blood spattered implements
awaiting cleaning rest in a metal bin near a gaping hole in the floor,
from which issue a variety of howls and pleas.

A Pit of Despair~
This vile place is where Quel'zar stores the results of his unholy
experiments. Unfortunately, it quickly became a struggle for survival
down here, and now a solitary creature resides here, devouring anything
else hurled down to join it.

A Twisting Corridor~
Ghastly shapes are visible on the walls here, illuminated by your light
source, the flickering glow giving them the semblance of movement...wait
a minute, they actually ARE moving, writhing and contorting spasmodically,
dancers to some unheard music, lost in the macabre ritual they are engaging
in. Occasionally one of the figures will turn towards you, revealing a face
with gaping eyesockets and a toothless maw, beckoning lewdly for you to join
in the obscene ritual. Shuddering, you press on.

A Twisting Corridor~
At this point utter darkness engulfs the corridor. Even your light
source cannot penetrate the gloom. You are reduced to having to stumble
forward, arms outstretched, praying you don't fall into some hidden pit.
At one stage your hands brushes what could be a door, but you aren't
sure.

Gloom~
You can't see a thing in here, so you have no idea what you may have
stumbled in on when you opened the door. Suddenly, you see something
flickering in the darkness, and sparks of magical energy cast a dim
glow on the stone walls, each of them filled with the wildly cavorting
figures you glanced earlier. Shuddering, you look away and prepare to
face whatever may lurk in this strange place.

A Twisting Corridor~
The darkness continues, threatening to engulf you, overwhelming your
senses, causing you to panic as you flail madly, feeling extremely
uncomfortable in this state of near total sensory deprivation. To the
east and west the corridor continues, while to the north and south lie
greasy stone walls.

A Horrid Sight~
All at once, the corridor plunges from the darkness into a chamber
filled with blinding white light, most of it issuing from a metal
cross affixed to the far wall, upon which is fastened a warning to those
who would challenge the might of Lilith. Above the cross is a shimmering
portal, which presumably leads up into the sanctum of the Queen of
Vampires herself. To the north, a plain wooden door leads to some unknown
location.

The purpose of this chamber escapes you. Only a small metal plaque
mars the plain stone walls, which are devoid of any signs of chaos.
Curious, you step in to examine the chamber further...

Swirling Vortex~
As you step through the portal, and invisible force grabs ahold of you
and hurls you into a swirling vortex of magical energies. Dozens of
exits spin past you, leading into worlds known and unknown; you pray
fervently that you will be thrown out where you intend to go.

The Handmaidens of Lilith~
This chamber is dominated by an opulent four poster bed, swathed in silk and
fine cloths. Incense burns in small clay pots near the bed, filling the room
with a sickly sweet odor, not unlike that of fresh blood. The walls are
covered in richly colored tapestries depicting the feasting of the kindred
upon the innocents of the world.

The Final Journey~
At long last the vortex deposits you in a blackwalled stone chamber,
filled to your knees with blood and gore, which seeps in through the
walls and floor. Sickened, you attempt to wade through the mire as
quickly as possible, heading for a blood free passage in the north wall,
which leads towards a series of metal doors. Someone or something cackles
with glee at your misfortunes, and you grit your teeth and try to ignore
it.

Chambers of the Slaves~
Here are quartered those selected to serve Lilith, in whatever manner
she may desire, kept in rooms to the east and west, under the watchful
eye of the Eunuch, who is compelled to remain in this empty chamber,
watching the doors for sign of escape or intrusion. Only four tapestries,
placed near each exit from this room, break the plain stone. A vile
smell emanates from the northern exit.

Path of the Damned~
Your first impression, as you traverse this bloodsoaked corridor, is that
many, many others have passed this way, and have fallen here, over the
centuries, nay millenia! Lilith, the greatest of succubi, the queen of
vampires, has claimed innumerable souls, and their blood coats this seemingly
endless passageway. Mangled, blackened corpses hang from hooks set in the
walls, dripping entrails onto the slick floor. The stench is overpowering;
even a vampire would find the overwhelming presence of blood sickening in
its gross excess. Undoubtedly worse waits ahead.

The Chamber of Lilith~
You have finally stumbled onto the true haven of Lilith, her private
boudoir, an opulent apartment appointed with all manner of rare and
valuable artifacts and works of art. Long drapes, of a soft material,
shroud most of the room, including an extravagant four poster bed, to
which someone is bound, though you cannot see through the gossamer to
determine who or what it is. Lilith will most surely be angered by your
persistence and audacity, and you expect her to react violently!
