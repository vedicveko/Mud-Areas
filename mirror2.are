mirror guard guardian~
the mirror guardian~
A mirror guardian stands here.
~
The guard's white beard and wrinkled skin prove him to be older than the 
average city guard. The post he holds is most likely a ceremonial one,
assigned to aged and honored soldiers, rather than fresh new warriors; it seems
probable from the silence around you that this part of the land gets few
visitors.  Even so, the guard stands motionless at his post, eyes fixed firmly
on the empty space in front of him.

A pale, withered knight looks up in surprise as you enter.
~
The knight moves slowly and vaguely with empty eyes gazing out of a white
wrinkled face; however, you can still see strong muscles below the tattered
hauberk he wears.  As he sees you, his gray, papery mouth opens, and his
eyes widen in surprise.....

king loranhir man~
King Loranhir~
King Loranhir sits quietly on his throne, gazing into emptiness. 
~
Loranhir is the king of the Mirror Realm; he caused the realm to be divided
after the battles over his creations, the sword Taliesin and the Sunrise 
Shield. He was the best craftsman in the land, and was known for his 
quiet advice and counsel; he was called upon to take the throne after the 
former king died while calling the forces of evil into the land.  He 
tried to destroy the Sword and Shield to keep them from falling into the 
hands of evil...but could not bring himself to destroy his own 
creations, and instead raised the mountains from the earth through a 
powerful spell, splitting the land in two--but leaving him unable to 
face his failure.

carvallo undertaker~
Carvallo~
Carvallo stands here, operating his "disposal" business.
~
Carvallo offers "quick and easy disposal" of just about anything you might want
to get rid of rather quickly--or at least anything that no one else will touch
(and he does mean ANYTHING).  Whatever you've got, he'll buy it...(and most 
likely turn it around for a handsome profit).

the young man~
A citizen of the Mirror Realm shuffles along the dark road.
~
The young man walks with his eyes lowered to the ground, and does not even
blink as he nears you.  His face is gaunt with fatigue and pain, and his
steps are short and uncertain, as if he has no real idea where he intends to 
go.

the moose~
A moose stands here, nibbling at the tree branches.
~
Moose are *weird*.  The animal has the antlers of a deer, except thicker; the
body of an antelope, the muzzle of a horse, and the fur of some kind of dog.
Strangely, the moose isn't a mythical creature, but is quite real, all 1200 
pounds of him.  Including the antlers.  And the hooves.  And the teeth.  Sure,
he's dopey, but still.....

the young urchin~
A young urchin shuffles about, ignoring the fruit that hangs from the trees.
~
Swamp mire and mud cover the boy's face, and smelly seaweed hangs from his 
shoulders; apparently the boy had decided that a swim in the swamp would do him
some good.  He refuses to raise his head, or even lift his feet off the ground;
he only extends his hand towards you, silently asking for money.

the Master of Light~
(Golden Aura) A figure of pure light rises from a sparkling throne.
 
~
The figure before you seems to be made entirely of rainbow light: the sparkling
wall behind it shines through its patterned, dazzling multicolored body, and
the thousands of rainbow rays seem to pass right through it without any effect
whatsoever.  Though you see the basic human form--two arms, two legs, a body
and head--they contain no features at all, and only radiate a bright golden
glow.

feathers intertwined with a few golden ones; its silvery beak glistens in the
light, with faint sparkles shining on its razor-sharp edges.

golden horn gold~
The unicorn's horn appears to be made of twisted gold tipped with a
glittering diamond; down at the base, where it was severed from the 
unicorn's head, you can see some dried blood and fibers.  As you hold 
the horn in your hand, you feel a strange current running through your 
body, as though it still retained life in some way.~

The land before you is the Mirror Realm, the realm of King Loranhir, who split
this land in two with a powerful spell, separating good and evil, Light and 
Dark, and cutting this land off from the outside world.  The Lords of the Light
and the Dark now control this realm, and will allow you to walk freely around
our realm (though none can guarantee safe passage through the evil lands, 
and none know what lies in the king's empty palace).  You may search as 
you like for the sword Taliesin and the Sunrise Shield, but you may not  
attempt to transport any citizen from one side of our realm to another, 
nor may you try to help any citizen leave....

As you slowly scan the land before you with the telescope, you see dozens of
different people and places: there is a lake surrounded by an orchard on one
side and a forest on the other, and a bride and a groom standing in a small
gazebo on the center of the lake; there are a series of buildings, which
could be houses or shops (it's too far away to tell clearly); there is a
beautiful unicorn in front of the sparkling tower, which now appears to be
made out of frosted glass; there are riders in robes of every color of the 
rainbow.

glittering palace of obsidian rises from the mire at the far end of the

blood red dagger~
.    The dagger before you is known as a blood dagger, and for good reason: as
it pierces its victim's flesh, it draws the victim's blood into its blade, 
absorbing its dark red color.  This particular dagger radiates an almost
black color, showing just how much use it has seen....
.    The arms of an evil-looking creature cover the handle, forming an 
excellent grip, while the creature's gaping mouth and head form the hilt 
at the dagger's top.  The blade itself has been notched like a saw, for 
extra destructive power....

power for the Lords and Masters of the Dark.  At first, it seems to contain 
only an image of the Sign of the Dark, a black, screaming raven of 
obsidian diving inside a circle of ivory bone....
.     The ivory and obsidian first catch your eye; the more common Signs of the
Dark are more simply made, carved out of one piece of wood or stone, rather
than made out of several different pieces...and as you look closer, you see 
runes inscribed all over the Sigil, runes that chill you to the heart.  You
realize that a cold power beats out of the Sigil, more than anything that ever
came out of any more usual sign....~

just a beautiful representation of the Sign of the Light: intricate runes have
been carved into its face, and the sigil as a whole glows with a warm, almost

history book mirror realm~
Long ago, a small town flourished at the edge of the River Satyr: open-air
markets sold all manner of supplies and trinkets to passing travellers;
artists painted beautiful paintings; musicians composed heart-rending pieces;
and skilled metalworkers combined the skills of blacksmiths and jewellers to
create magnificent swords and armor.

One of these mastercraftsmen was Loranhir, one of the greatest artisans in the
realm, who was known for his excellent counsel and advice as well as for his 
beautiful creations.  He was trusted and respected--perhaps more so than the 
king, for King Hollar rarely left his jeweled palace to see his people, and 
seemed more concerned with riches than with rule.

[type "look mirror2" to see the next page]
~
E
mirror2~
And King Hollar was not an honest king, but was allied with evil forces, forces
that kept him wealthy and strong, but which fed his desire for power.  He 
commissioned Loranhir to make him a new shield and sword, more powerful than
any other, secretly wishing to control as much of the land as possible.

As Loranhir worked on the sword, King Hollar worked further with the dark 
forces, finally drawing them into his peaceful realm.  A struggle began 
between the good citizens and the thieves and murderers who sought to 
took over...and when the sword and the shield were finished, the 
struggle focused on them, for whoever controlled them would surely 
win...Loranhir, realizing what had been done, rose up and slew the king 
with Taliesin, the sword he had created.  And the people nominated him 
king, for they knew his wisdom.

[type "look mirror3" to see the last page]
~
E

But the damage had been done.  Though Evil had not taken over the land, it had
still taken a foothold, and the battles began again for control of the Shield
and the Sword.

And the new King Loranhir could not bring himself to destroy his creations.

Through a powerful magic spell, he called a mountain up from the land, raising
a rock wall between good and evil, and separating them forever.  The Sword and
Shield were hidden, never to be found by any but those most dedicated to the
realm.....

Michael Seifert, Hans Henrik St{rfelt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe, and our

Beginning of the Path~
A rough dirt path meets the edge of the field here, nestled between two big
groves of trees; it slopes upwards off the ground as it heads off to the east,
curving behind a cluster of evergreens.  Beyond the trees, a mountain range
stretches high into the air, with the tallest peak rising steeply enough to
prevent anything from taking root.

The Path~
The row of trees comes to an end here; the fields to either side of the rising
path slope downward and away.  The path continues its rise to the north,
climbing higher and higher until it intersects the largest mountain in the 
range, nestled between a smaller mountain to the right and a deep ridge to the
left.

Bend in the Path~
The path curves gently to the west and north, growing narrower as it rises
farther and farther from the valley below.  The thinner air makes breathing
difficult; the stiff wind seems to pull the air right out of your mouth.  
Fortunately, the end of the path lies just a moderate distance ahead; it
appears to lead to a pair of doors set right into the mountain's face.

Approaching the Face of the Mountain~
The dirt of the path has given way to solid rock; this section of the path
seems to be part of the mountain itself.  It appears that the doors a little 
way to the north offer the only access into whatever lies inside the mountain.
The land far below you has given way to a rough sea that surrounds the base of 
the mountain, broken only by the distant base of this rocky path.  Another path
stretches east and west from here; a small sign gives directions.

light shines unbroken through the crack between them; like the woodwork

circle of ivy surrounding an arching rainbow, while the door on the right
portrays a diving black raven inside a circle of bone.  Smaller figures 
surround the larger symbols; the left door contains figures like beautiful 
blooming flowers and a bard playing a silver harp, while the door on the right
contains more grim images, including the skeleton of a horse and a ship
foundering in a storm.~

The Path Above the Realm~
As you pass through the thick doorway and enter the mountain, bright sunlight
strikes your eyes: the mountain's top has apparently been blown off by some
ancient eruption, allowing light and life to reach down into the valleys 
below. Two villages have sprung up on either side of this high path, set far 
below you in the valley floor.  The two seem to be almost identical, save for 
two features: the valley to the west is colorful, with a bright, sparkling 
tower set against the western rim; the valley to the east is grimmer, darker, 
with a glittering black tower rising in front of the mountain's eastern rim.

Along the Path Above the Realm~
From here it appears that this path divides this realm; not only are the two
sides nearly identical, but you can see a house far below you that has been 
split in two by the base of this pathway, half on either side of the rock wall.  
The path continues to the north, passing by a guard post and heading towards
a castle partially hidden behind a low rock wall.

The wooden guard station looks out over the bright, colorful side of the
realm; large, open windows let you watch over the land as a whole, and 
a telescope bolted to the floor allows you to look more closely.  The room is
empty, save for the telescope--there are no beer bottles, pictures, or even
chairs here; the only thing on the floor is an open hatchway with a large black
iron knob.

As you look northwards towards the castle, you see a faint movement that mimics

Entrance to the Great Hall~
The dim light of the doorway behind you barely sheds light on this enormous
room; even with your own light, you can only see a few feet around you.  
The walls and floor appear to be made of the usual mirrors--the room is too
high and too dark to see the ceiling--but here tapestries hang on the walls,
while a thick red rug covers the floor.  The tapestry behind you shows a boat
cresting a deep blue wave; the others are too far away to see clearly.

The Center of the Great Hall~
From your position in the center of the hall, you can see that the set of
tapestries on each wall forms a complete picture; for example,the two simple
blue tapestries on the back wall form the sea that the king's ship sails on in 
the center.  The tapestry on the northern wall doesn't follow this pattern,
however; a recessed alcove fills the center of the wall, flanked by tapestries
depicting a magnificent shining sword and a sparkling jewelled shield.

Though the knight's horse has fled, running off the right side of the tapestry,
the knight still struggles on, hacking through burning bushes to reach the 
frenzied unicorn in the center.

the one in front of you is more interesting: it shows a sparkling, golden-

figures fills the tapestry's border, apparently telling the history of some
battle between good and evil--perhaps a battle over the sword itself.

brush, his face is set and determined.

a rather unusual sigil on the hilt: the sign of good, a rainbow inside a 
flowering vine, is linked with the sign of evil, a lightning bolt inside
a circle of bone.

light in every direction.

Two paths converge here at the very back of a well-kept garden: a fine gravel
path, bordered with white brick, runs north and south along the outside of the
garden, while a wooden bridge leads west over a small pond.  The watchtower and
the mountain path lie far above you, on the top of the high, rocky ridge that
encircles this entire valley; part of the ridge itself, its surface marked by
an arching crack, stands right beside you, rising high enough to block your

Under the Gazebo~
Though shadowed from the sun, the water under the gazebo glows with an
odd, white light: pale, glowing fish fill the water, and small, almost 
microscopic animals have stuck their glowing bodies like barnacles onto the
gazebo's bottom.

Under the Bridge~
A wooden bridge rises from the land to the east, passing over the water
and heading westwards towards a small gazebo.  The gazebo itself is high 
enough to travel under; the bridge rises fairly high off the water--
high enough to prevent you from leaving the pond by the eastern bank.

waves wash against the shores to the east and south.  A wooden bridge
crosses the pond to the north, leading to a round gazebo covered with vines.

A dark forest lies just to the south, while a small hut lies to the
west, standing on stilts above the cool blue water. You can hear the pond 
just to the north; a thick tangle of reeds and trees blocks your path, however,
so you'll have to find a different path if you want to go swimming....

Below the Fisherman's Hut~
A small hut rises on stilts here, standing partially over the water.  Someone
has hung nets of various sizes and smells from the window to dry, and you can
just see a fishing pole hung on the inside wall.  

Thick woods lie to the south and east, while a small path lies to the west and
the pond lies to the north.

The pond's waters are somewhat more murky here, perhaps tainted by all the 
greenery growing on the gazebo to the north; there are a bunch of dead leaves
floating here, with some algae growing around them.  The row of buildings lies
to the east of here, just beyond the gravel pathway; from here, however, you
can't see what any of them might hold.

The pond~
This area of the pond appears to be home to a whole family of goldfish:

by.  A large, almost pure white goldfish seems to be the center of attention--
smaller goldfish nip at it almost endlessly.

buildings as it curves around the pond.  The rainbow tower climbs high into the
air behind the buildings, sparkling from red on the lowest level to deep purple
at the top; shadowy movements inside the tower indicate that its octagonal
walls must be made of transparent glass.

The gravel path continues behind the row of buildings here; it banks downwards

sunflowers grow on either side of the path, almost high enough to form an arch;
they wave gently as the breeze blows through them.

The gravel path continues north and south, and is intersected here by another
small pathway: a wooden bridge crosses the pond to the east, while a dirt path
heads towards the buildings to the west.  Hardly any flowers grow here--the
paths and the pond take up too much room--though you do see a few daffodils
here and there.

Daffodils and tulips line this part of the path, growing in almost every color
possible; there are even some daffodils growing just in the water of the pond
to the east.  To the west, the flowers' growth is slowed somewhat by the 
wooden buildings that block the sun; most look healthy, though, since they
still get light most of the day.  Once again, the sparkling rainbow tower
dominates the horizon to the west, seeming to reach almost as high as the
mountain wall itself.

Center of the Street~
A smooth dirt pathway runs north and south between two rows of wooden
buildings, each with a large, painted sign out front.  The buildings 
themselves are all connected, and look to be about two stories high; each
shopkeeper probably has their own private quarters above their store.  
The glittering tower stands just to the west, its entrance protected
by a narrow moat; the garden lies to the east.

two very different shops: a big window dominates the shop to the west, bordered
by sprigs of holly; familiar smells of baked ham, turkey, and roast beef waft 
out from the open doorway.  A small, dark, windowless shop lies to the east, 
with a simple sign over its doorway; a cloth covers the entrance, preventing
you from seeing inside.

The Sorcery~
The wizard's storefront is dark, and the shelves are nearly empty; everything
of importance must lie behind the counter. ("Detect hidden or no detect

runes are painted on the ceiling, and are glowing faintly in the

There are quite a few signs here: the sign of the Light, a rainbow inside a

One says, "Looks can be deceiving....especially when evil is involved."  Another
says, 

    list--Type list to see a list of what the shopkeeper has.
    buy <item>--to buy the item.  If there are two items with the same name,
		use "buy 2.item" to buy the second, and so on.
    sell <item>--to sell something, assuming this shopkeeper buys anything.
    value <item>--will tell you how much this shopkeeper will pay for a given
		  item.

The bar of the Holly Bush~
The bar of the Holly Bush is quiet right now, though from the number of stools
and tables, it looks as though it must be rather popular.  The restaurant lies
to the north, with a big "Seat Yourself" sign over the doorway; while there
are a few more people in there, it's still not all that crowded.

A small wooden staircase leads upwards to the bedrooms.

are made of some dark brown wood.  A young couple shares a meal in the booth
to your right, partially hidden behind a small fern; the kitchen door, blocked
by a row of tables, flops open and shut constantly as the waiter rushes in 
and out.

A sparkling crystal tower rises high into the air above this small village,
glittering in every color of the rainbow: clear crystal forms the highest and
lowest floors, while the floors in between run from red to orange to yellow to
green to blue and finally to a deep violet.  The moat below you sparkles, 
reflecting the tower's colors; it seems to be more a thing of beauty than a 
form of defense.

Two wooden pathways meet here before the cracked rock face, providing the only

fairly rickety, they seem to have held up fairly well under the gloom and muck

the swamp mud is a deep black, while the sun and sky themselves seem 
dull and gray.

its black muddy waters occasionally splash over the side of the path, leaving
stinking puddles on the grey, rotten wood.
To the west lies a small wooden house; the mountain wall appears to have torn
it in two.

away in a thick cluster of bushes and cattails that hangs over the 
northern end of the pond.

block your vision into the forest, and block the light as well; it seems to be
almost completely black beyond the treeline.

A Grove of Trees ~
The thick grove of trees blocks almost all light from reaching the ground;
the forest grows densely here beside the rock wall to the north, stretching
high into the air as it tries to catch the few feeble rays of light that do 
make it down through the gloom.

The Swamp~
Thick bushes grow at the northern end of the swamp, with their roots striving
to hold them in the steep, marshy ground.  A small gazebo stands to the south,
seeming to have lost the struggle against the decay of the swamp; 
several of its gray boards have fallen into the waters below.

Under the Gazebo~
Broken boards, fallen from the gazebo floor, poke out of the muddy water here;
their rusty nails form a treacherous maze.  The fallen boards allow you to see
into the gazebo above you, but it's too dark to make out much of anything,
except for a few flickering shadows; however, you can hear the shufflings of
what might be human footsteps.  Small slugs appear to have helped the natural
decay process; hundreds of them are stuck to the underside of the gazebo floor,
and appear to be happily munching away.

The Swamp ~
The black swamp water deepens here, splashing gently against the more solid
land to the east and south.  A rickety hut stands above the southern edge of
the pond, half over the swamp and half over the marshland; the supports on its
left side have rotted away, leaving it tilted sharply to one side, and most
likely preventing anyone from calling it their home.

Below the Fisherman's Hut~
A gray wooden hut teeters here on six rickety supports, hanging partially over
the waters of the swamp; on the western side, two of the supports have 
partially given way, making the hut lean sharply downwards.  More stable 
ground lies to the south--at least, it's stable enough to allow a dense, 
dark grove of trees to grow high into the air.

Corner of the Path ~
The wooden path bends here, heading west through a thicker grove of trees and
southwards past a row of old, flimsy wooden houses.  The stench of the swamp is
somewhat less here, probably because of the fresh air that spills over the
mountain wall to the north and east; in any case, your stomach isn't churning
quite as much now.....

Small cones of rock line the walls, forming a somewhat uneven ladder that

Center of the Street~
A rough, muddy path runs north and south between two rows of wooden buildings,
each with a tarnished sign out front.  The gray wood has begun to rot away
from all the exposure to the water and swamp muck, and the second story
as a whole looks rather unsteady.  The glittering black tower to the east 
seems to be the only stable building in the entire realm, unaffected by the
mire of the swamp to its west.

Street ~
Mud and pond scum have oozed over the wooden pathway and are flowing down the
gutters of the muddy street, picking up garbage on the way.  This whole section
of the street has a pungent, almost acidic smell, though you can't tell whether
it's coming from the shops to the east and west or the sewage that lies below.
The doorway to the south leads to a private home--or so it seems, since there's
no sign out front--and is covered by a thin black cloth, probably in an attempt
to keep out the smell.

The Bar of the Hemlock Bush~
A huge horse's skull hangs over the grim, dirty bar; candles in its eye sockets
make it stare at you menacingly.  Pools of strange, smelly fluids are scattered
all over the floor; some eat away at the paint of the rickety chair legs, while
others glow faintly in the dim light.  A few drunks have fallen asleep on a
table just behind the bar, barricaded in by the wreckage of a few old tables
and chairs; it looks like a few of them may have caused those puddles just
below you.

Strange murals cover the walls of this restaurant--they're apparently some sort
of abstract art, since instead of portraying a series of figures or a broad 
landscape, they contain dizzying (and rather unappetizing) swirls of colors,
with only the faintest hint of demonic-looking figures here and there.  The 
floor is liberally coated with vomit and scum, and many of the chairs look to
have fallen victim to the same fight that took out most of the bar.

this land; you can also see faint shadows that move in the moat below you, 
along with a few sporadic streams of bubbles that rise up from the deep, 
slimy waters.

posts and roof, but it has since died, leaving only twisted branches in its
place.

Here, the forest stretches along the southernmost wall of this valley, with

and even wet in some places; a thin trickle of water is running down the side
of the wall here, perhaps coming from melting ice at the top of this high wall.
A tall weeping willow tree grows right by the mountain wall, with its long
branches brushing against the ground; several of its thin, green leaves have
been swept downwards by the small trickle of water, and have been washed
to the ground.

The high mountain wall stretches north and east from here, restricting the

As you enter the surprisingly well-built treehouse, you hear the hum of

through netting around the hole in the roof.
A thick tree branch passes through the whole left side of the house, leading

Up the Tree ~
As you push past thick, leafy branches, you suddenly emerge in dim light; the
top of this tree has been devoured by some sort of insect, preventing you from
going any further.  You are just above the canopy of this small forest; the 
glittering obsidian structure towers above the treeline in the distance to the
northeast.

Dark Forest~
A tall weeping willow tree droops over the forest floor here, with its branches
brushing against the ground. Though the forest canopy is thinner here, it is
still quite dark; the sun itself is not powerful enough to shine through the
gloom that surrounds this land.

Dark Forest ~
A huge tree dominates this corner of the forest, its thick trunk stretching
through the dense canopy of branches above you.  The canopy itself seems 
thicker here than elsewhere in the forest, allowing only a few rays of 
light to reach the forest floor.

Dark Forest ~
The trees here are covered with damp gray moss, and their branches drip slime 
all over the rocky wall to the south, making it impossible to climb.  A thin 
shaft of blue sky is just visible over the southern mountain wall, far 
beyond the boundaries of this dark realm; another stretch of blue lies to the
west, beyond the mountain wall that separates this valley from the next.

Dark Forest ~
The thick rock wall stretches north and west from here, rising almost 
vertically, steep enough to prevent any trees from taking root.  Wisteria,
however, has been able to make its home in the cracks and holes worn into 
the rock wall; it stretches high up along the rock wall, reaching almost to
its top.

Vell, hi!~
This is the hideout of Bear D. Bear....a VERY weird creature if there ever
was one.  You're not supposed to be here....trust me.  I know.  I wrote this
area :-).  Anyway, better recall or get someone to transfer you out of here,
'cause this is just a room used by mobprogs.....

(P.S.  Bear D. Bear is Merriman's sister's teddy bear.....*cackle*)

The Fisherman's Hut~
The rickety floor sags below you as you enter, and as you take another step 
forward, the whole hut drops sharply, sending you flying forward through
an enormous hole in the western wall....

...and you land with a *SPLAT* in the murky waters of the swamp.  The black 
mire sticks to your clothing, and gets in your mouth; it smells awful, and now
so do you.

A Mirror Staircase~
Dizziness begins to set in as you climb the mirrored spiral staircase; the
reflective steps make it hard to judge where your foot should go.  A simple
torch bolted on the wall casts a dim light around the staircase, allowing you
to see the intersection below and the continuing staircase above you.

A Small Room~
For once, a room in the castle without mirrors!  Simple wooden beams make up
the walls and ceiling of this open-air room; sunlight streams in the eight
narrow windows, giving the room a bright, almost cheerful air.  Bits of twigs
and branches cover the floor, piled into a large nest in the center of the room
by some sort of bird....

The Crystal Altar~
Warm rays of sun filter through cool ivy leaves, and you hear the faint splash
of water far below you; you have entered a small room inside the top of the
gazebo, enclosed by its wooden framework.  The wooden panel sits in the
floorboard beneath you; a simple wooden knob is attached across from two
shiny brass hinges.

In Front of the Hive~
The glass tubes end here, and lead into a huge hole in the tree's trunk--
apparently the bees' true home is before you.  As a cool breeze blows towards
you, the smell of delicious honey fills your nostrils, apparently coming from
the hive before you....

Inside the Hive~
Honeybees surround you on all sides, completely covering the to and sides of
this hollow in the tree; in some places, the bees are two or three deep, and
crawl over each other as they move seemingly randomly about the hive.  The
bees buzz loudly but not ominously; many of them have been calmed by the
smoke, and the rest seem to be content to ignore you and make the delicious
honey whose sweet, sticky scent fills the air.

The Violet Altar~
The sounds of the forest slowly drop to silence as you enter this cool, 
sweet-smelling room.  Small, feathery violet petals cover the ceiling and 
walls, bathing this cave with a dark purple light; they flutter gently
as a cool breeze wafts through.  From time to time, a few petals fall 
from the ceiling, gently brushing your face and hands; as you look, you see
that a new petal slowly unfurls from the place where the falling one used
to lie.

Inside the House: The Living Room~
Splintered wood and shattered furniture are everywhere: the rising of the
mountain wall has almost completely destroyed this room.  Falling rock has
bashed a large hole in the wall to the west, allowing you to head outside;
to the north, a doorway still provides access to another room.

Inside the House: The Kitchen~
Strangely, the rising of the mountain has barely affected this room: 
the furniture stands intact, and the walls are unscathed; even the
brick oven rests unaffected in a fissure in the mountain wall.

A large fire burns in a fireplace in the north wall, kept in check
by a thick iron grate.

Inside the Fire: The Red Altar~
You enter the fire....and find an open space in its midst.

The roaring fire surrounds you, but somehow does not touch you: the 
glittering altar before you seems to cast a sphere of protection about
itself, keeping the flames at a safe distance.  The heat still envelops
you, though, threatening to cook you with its intensity; the fire is
to be far hotter and larger than it seemed from the outside.

Crawling Through the Oven~
The oven is large enough to allow you to pass through, though it's low 
enough to force you to crawl; your knees and hands quickly become dirty 
from all the black soot that covers the deep brown bricks.  Two steel 
oven doors lie at one end of the passage, while a single thick panel lies 
at the other.

The Bedroom~
A thick fallen beam has broken the master bed's frame in two, and has 
knocked a hole in the dusty eastern wall, allowing the outside gloom to
seep in.  The back of a brick oven stove lies on the west wall, undamaged
by the rise of the mountain wall; though it now stands cold with its panel
shut, it probably once provided the heat for this small room.

Diving~
You dive downwards through crystal-clear, cool blue water.  As you look 
around, you see that this section of the pond is actually somewhat deeper 
than the rest: the pond floor slopes downwards into a deep indentation. The 
gazebo casts a faint white reflection on the water above you....and you can 
see what appears to be some sort of cave lying just ahead.

Underwater Cave: The Blue Altar~
As you swim onwards, you see a light above you and a rock wall ahead of you;
you surface, and find yourself inside a cool subterranean cave.  Gentle
waterfalls splash downwards from large cracks in the ceiling; they completely
cover all four walls, cooling the air dramatically and giving the cave a 
fresh, clean scent.  The waterfalls--as well as the water you came from--
sparkle in the misty light that shines from a large altar in the center of
the room.

A layer of damp green moss covers every inch of this small, dark cave; shoots
of ivy grow through the moss on the walls, while thick clover covers the 
ground.  Crickets and beetles, hidden somewhere in the ivy, chirp loudly
in the cool, moist air, and the head of a white dove just peeks out of a 
nest of green branches.

The Suite~
A lava lamp provides the only illumination in this dark, smoky room; its
dim purple light allows you to see tie-dyed blankets hanging on the walls,
as well as funky glowing posters with weird, swirling designs.  Poems and
phrases have been scribbled all over the walls and ceilings in a wide
variety of colors, ranging from simple black to fluorescent green.
Musky incense and other smells envelop you, and you drift into a sort of 
psychedelic fugue....
