The Diamond Room~
This lovely room sparkles like the diamond for which it is named. Normally
this room serves as a honeymoon suite for the young lovers of Evermeet. With
its large cozy bed covered in soft, fluffy pillows and the hot tub in the
other corner, it is no wonder this room is among one of the favorites of the
house. This seems to be an ideal place to start (or restart) a budding romance.

The several private rooms that are available are almost always in use for one
purpose or another, but I'm sure if you just ask, Throleatha can find a room
to suit your needs.

The Queen's Private Room~
This beautifully decorated room is obviously where the queen spends most of
her time when she is alone. With the lush decor of the room and the enormous
crystal baywindow that overlooks the city, you can hardly blame her. Two large
divans are next to the window, perfect for relaxing in and enjoying the view.

say you love them. Insulting him is not normally a good idea, and he tends to
get his delicate designer feelings hurt with the slightest frown.
