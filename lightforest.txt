This was originally the Miden'Nir, re-mapped and remobbed as a basic
connector zone.  It is now fit to connect to 8 seperate zones, more if
desired, with low level mobs to populate it.  It would be my suggestion
that, if you used this zone, take the mobs and junk them and make new
ones.  The ones in this zone suck pretty bad - it has been on my list to
redo them, but I have never actually gotten around to it - always have
an excuse to do something else;-)

Enjoy!
