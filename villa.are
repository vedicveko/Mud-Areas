flint knapper flint-knapper~
the village flint-knapper~
The village flint-knapper is here repairing crude tools.
~
While the knapper's primary job is to craft tools for the village, such is
his skill that he may also be able to repair your equipment. Contact with
merchants from more advanced civilisations to the south have made him
remarkably conversant with the properties of metals such as copper and silver 
and alloys such as bronze.

wise woman~
the village wise woman~
The village wise woman cracks a toothless grin as you enter.
~
Age may have taken what beauty this crone once possessed, but it hasn't 
robbed her of her wits. She is more knowledgable in the properties of items
than anyone else in the known world (which, admittedly, doesn't cover very
much. In fact, to these villagers it is about as far as you can see on a 
clear day).

in his ability to exact obedience. That bear sure doesn't look tame...

the village brewer~
The village brewer is handing out samples of his sacred drink.

The art of brewing is held sacred by the northern tribes, and the brewers
are considered holy men. In accordance with their beliefs, the brewers hand
out samples of their sacred draught to all who pass by, and while there is
no real cost, a small "donation" to the sacred coffer is expected. And when 
the brewer is the size of a grizzly bear, few refuse.

chieftain~

The village chieftain welcomes you to her village.
~
This strapping giant of a woman has flaming red hair and biceps bigger than
your thighs. She has ruled this village wisely for many years, through lean 
times and times of plenty, and her people have the utmost faith in her
ability. Time and the birth of many children have not softened her 
well-muscled frame - she is still a very attractive woman, and the men of the 
village (and some women too) vie for her favours.

The Interior of the Shaman's Hut~
You cough as you enter the smoky interior of this cramped hut, your eyes
watering as the odor of some bubbling concoction in an iron cauldron wafts
toward you. In the center of this hut the shaman awaits, quietly meditating.
A variety of furs, bones, charms and trinkets line the walls, doubtless
serving as focii for the shaman's mystic powers.

You are greeted with a sudden blast of heat from the furnace as you enter
the smithy. Wiping sweat from your brow, you gaze about, taking the place
in. Various items of armor in various stages of repair line the walls. A
huge, muscular man is using a massive hammer to beat the dents out of a
suit of rather battered-looking bronze plate. The flint-knepper has learnt
skills far more advanced than his contemporaries, thanks to the many
visitors this village attracts, and his forge shows evidence of this.

A Path in the Village~
You are strolling along a path in the village. Flecks of white snow are blown
about on the hard ground by a chill northern breeze that blows in from the
icy mountains far to the north. You hope that you will be able to find
a hot meal and a comfortable bed this evening.

Food is in fact available to the south of here, though it isn't hot.

A Supply Hut~
Some enterprising young women have set up a small shop here, where they
sell off the surplus food that is not required to provision their Clans.
You may purchase supplies for your travels here.

It is here that the village Brewer practices his holy trade. Should you

donation is in order.

Outside a Village Clan Hut~
You are standing outside a hut in the village. It is a wooden walled structure
with a thatched roof, and a sturdy oak door. Occasionally a villager enters
or exits the hut, sparing you a curious glance as they do. A crude etching
upon the doors of this hut marks it as the Eagle Clan hut.

Inside the Hut~
You are standing inside the hut. The sounds and smells of cooking emanate
from the east, while quiet conversation can be heard to the west. You feel
slightly nervous about intruding upon this clan, but then again that's
what your profession is all about, really. Intruding.
