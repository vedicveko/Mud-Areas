This is an add-on to another builder's zone, however by the time that
Greyfeather got finished with it (the zone started with like 30 rooms,
I believe) it did even remotely resemble the original zone. This is a
forest city with many of the buildings in the trees. Very well-written
and excellent for use as a hometown.
