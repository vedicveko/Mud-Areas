{YThe Yawning Portal{x~
The lobby is plainly furnished and is warm and inviting.  The walls bear
marks as though they have been struck by thrown objects but you see no
evidence of exactly what might have been thrown.  Beyond the lobby and to
the north you see a large inviting room.  Behind the counter to the east is
a door leading presumably to the back room.  The air smells clean, almost
sterile.  To the south is the door that leads out to Dirk Lane.

{YCommon Room{x~
You are in a large, warm room that has been modestly appointed.  The
floor is wooden and has been polished meticulously and apparently quite
frequently as there are no scuffs or other signs of wear.  In the back of
the room opposite the entrance is a stairway leading up.  The stairs appear
to have been treated to the same level of attention as the floor.  The
pleasant sounds and smells of the crackling fireplace fill this room.

here.  The one to the west has a one next to it and the other, to the east,
has a five.  There are stairs leading down into the common room.  This
hallway has a wooden floor that appears to be new or is treated to a
phenomenal level of care.  The air smells like it has somehow been scrubbed
clean of all dirt or uncleanliness.

slightly musty and the room is a little damp.  The air is cool down here.

establishment, firmly attached to the wall here.  From inside the tavern you
can hear singing and the occasional n ame calling match.  The tavern is warm
and inviting and there is a pleasant odor of roast something wafting your
way.  To the south of you is the exit to Dungeon Drive.

This is the inside of the armourer Hilmer's establishment.  All around
are the fruits of his labor.  The shop is not decorated other than by the
wares he has on display.  The air smells of hot coal and metal and is very
warm, almost uncomfortably so.  There is a door in the west wall that leads
outside to Dirk Lane and doors in the north and south walls that most likely
go to private parts of the shop.  To the east is an open area where Hilmer
works.

You are at the northern end of Mandrake where it intersects with the
beginning of North Street to the east.  To the south Mandrake Avenue
stretches out before you totally congested with traffic and bordered its
entire length by building after closely packed building.  The cobbled stones
of the roads have been worn smooth by the volume of traffic.  Carts and
horses and people on foot are constantly going here and there regardless of
the time of day.  The air is cool and moist and smells like a stuffy linen
closet.

from here and intersects with another street to the south.  To the east is a
break in the tightly packed buildings, a clearing in the urban forest, the
{BBath House{x.  You can hear the occasional laugh coming from inside.  From
time to time someone will go in dirty or come out clean and refreshed.  To
the west is a small alley cutting its way through the jam packed buildings
lining that side of the street.

convergence of traffic here that occurs regardless of the time of day.  This
city never seems to sleep.  The air smells as varied as the people who walk
through it.  Your senses are further assaulted by the echo that occurs
because of the street encasing buildings that continue without relief.

directions.  This section of road is in a minor state of disrepair compared
to the rest of Mandrake Avenue.  There are several cobble stones missing
from the otherwise flawless surface.  You can see signs that repairs are
underway but no one is currently doing them.  The air smells of stone and
damp earth and has a slight chill to it.

stones of the street have been worn smooth by constant traffic which never
seems to ebb.  The air is cool here but the many tightly packed buildings
keep it virtually still.  To the north Mandrake Avenue intersects with
another street and to the south Mandrake continues on as far as you can see.

smooth and in excellent condition.  The air smells damp with earthen
undertones.  The street is crowded all times of the day and the sounds
echoing off the tightly packed buildings only serve to magnify this effect.

south of here.  To the east is the beginning of Dungeon Drive.  There are
many guards travelling to and from this road as well as many citizens coming
here to get water for their homes.

Several merchants come and go from the bank, increasing their wealth with

north runs Mandrake Avenue and to the south is where Mandrake crosses the
Durgas river.  East is the beginning of Riverfront Way which follows the
east-west course of the Durgas.  The cobbled stones here are somewhat damp
and the smell of the river is quite disturbingly foul.  This whole street
has been packed with buildings and this area is no exception.  In some areas
partially demolished buildings have had new constructions started before the
demolition was finished.

{YIntersection of Mandrake Avenue and South Bank Drive{x~
This is the intersection of two large, busy streets.  Mandrake Avenue
crosses the Durgas river to the north and continues on to the the south. 
South Bank Drive begins to the east and you can see another intersection in
that direction.  The air here is quite foul from the use of the river as a
sewage system.  The street is tightly packed with buildings, many of which
are growing fungi and spores of various types.  The road is moist and the
well worn stones are somewhat slick.

{YMandrake Avenue 1100 Block{x~
You are on Mandrake Avenue.  The air here has a faint scent of something
foul.  All around you are buildings pushed tightly together.  It is
difficult to tell where one building ends and the next begins.  To the north
you can see an intersection with another street and to the south Mandrake
Avenue continues.

{YMandrake Avenue 1200 Block{x~
The smooth stones of Mandrake Avenue lay at your feet.  The street is
overcrowded with nameless establishments, apartments and closed doors.  The
dizzying array of building fronts and loud echoing creates an air of tension
here.  The air smells faintly of the sea.  Mandrake Avenue continues on both
to the north and south of here.

{YMandrake Avenue 1300 Block{x~
You can see the end of Mandrake Avenue to the south where it meets up
with another main road.  The street here is less crowded with people but
still flanked on both sides by an unbroken stretch of building fronts.  To
the north Mandrake Avenue stretches as far as you can see.  The hard cobbled
stones at your feet have been worn smooth by years of service and the road
has been kept in excellent condition.  There are no stones missing and the
street is very clean.  The air here smells more strongly of the sea and you
can hear sea birds off in the distance.

{YCorner of Mandrake Avenue and Calinth Way{x~
You are at the end of Mandrake Avenue and the beginning of Calinth Way. 
Mandrake Avenue stretches off to the north as far as you can see.  Calinth
Way begins to the east where you can see an intersection with another
street.  The road here appears to be used quite heavily as the cobbled
stones are quite worn.  There is traffic here at all times of the day and
the many tightly packed buildings help to create a closed in feel to the
street.  The air smells strongly of the sea.  You can hear the water in the
distance and the sounds of birds calling out to each other.  The occasional
bell can be heard as well.

The cobbled road turns here.  Dirk Lane continues on to the north and to
the west.  From the door to the east you can hear the ringing sounds of a
hammer striking metal.  There is a sign over the door that reads 'Halls of
Hilmer'.  You can smell a furnace and hot metal in the air.  The street is
not as crowded here and you are able to move more freely.

to the west a busier intersection awaits. Various townsfolk move to and from the
jail door here, dropping of items for friends or family in the jail. There is a
heavy guard presence in this area.

{YIntersection of South Bank Drive and Hedram Place{x~
This segment of the slick South Bank Drive is highlighted by a juncture
with Hedram Place to the south.  To the west is the beginning of South Bank
Drive and to the east the drive continues as far as the crowded street will
allow you to see.  The stench here is quite difficult to bear as evidenced
by the occasional passerby losing his lunch near the river bank.  To the
north one could enter the Durgas river and become more closely familiar with
its stench and the source of this foulness.  The cobbled stones here are
damp and have growth on them, despite this treacherous road condition the
people who travel this road move quite quickly and many appear to be holding
their breath.

{YHedram Place 100 Block{x~
You are at the beginning of Hedram Place, an oft-used roadway for
merchants and carriers heading towards the docks.  The cobbled stones here
are in varying states of disrepair as if no city stonemasons have been
through here in quite some time.  This unusual feature is compounded by the
fact that the buildings here actually have small spaces between them.  The
echo effect is lessened and you can actually hear the sound of the foul
Durgas river to the north, the smell of course is always present and
eternally sickening.  Hedram place ends to the north where it intersects
with a larger road.  To the south the road intersects another side road and
continues on towards the bay.  There is a door to the west with a sign
labeled {BThe Wandering Wemic{x overhead.

This juction is less crowded and the traffic is smoother somehow.  Most
of the buildings in this area show no signs of any recent or current
activity.  Still, there are many people on the cobbled road going about
their business or just wandering the streets.  Hedram Place continues north
and south from here and Troll Street begins to the east.  You catch the
faint whiff of something very foul.

You are on a relatively nondescript section of Hedram Place.  Nameless
buildings surround you on both sides, their closed doors keeping their
secrets inside.  The street is busy with activity all times of the day and
the smell of sea air compliments the musky odor of horses and other beasts
of burden carrying their master's wares.  To the north and the south Hedram
Place intersects with other roads.

You are at an intersection of two streets.  The crowded streets give no
headway here as convoluted traffic surges through this junction.  The smell
of sea salt fills the air and you can feel the occasional breeze as it
squeezes its way through the tightly packed buildings or crashes over their
roofs like a wave.  To the north lies Hedram Place a narrow less-trafficked
throughway.  To the west Calinth Way comes to an end and joins up with
another street.  To the east Calinth Way continues onward filled with
travelers.

couples and elderly citizens.  Within moments patrons feel revived and
desire to have a dunk in the main pool.  The only exit is a door to the
west.

{YManager's Office{x~
This is the Manager's office.  This room is lavishly decorated and
appears to have no real function other than to cater to the manager's whims.
There is nothing in this office to indicate that any real work is performed
here.  The air here has a sweet smell, like rose petals.  To the north is
the door that leads back to the loan agent's area.

in the pool.  Children and there families are in abundance.  No one has

any feelings of romance.  There are steps leading up out of the pool.
