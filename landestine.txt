The Baroness Landestine took over the small but extremely wealthy
Barony she runs when her husband passed on some years back. She
was always a socialite, always very interested in the politics of
court and always very generous with her home and worldly 
possessions. Her castle is a place of constant activity with
endless balls night after night and day after day.
