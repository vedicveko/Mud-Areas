This zone was hastily written in less than a day with many same-room
descriptions and only a few mobs. It is a three story building with
mobs waiting to be slaughtered. It was built in response to the need
for an exp gaining zone at the low-mid levels near to Midgaard, which
is usually a player's choice for a hometown.
