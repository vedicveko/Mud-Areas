#HELPS
0 'Through the Looking Glass' 'Looking Glass'~

This area was written on a DOS Text Editor by Yaegar, based on the two best-
known works of the brilliant and eccentric Lewis Carroll. It is not a literal
interpretation- some aspects cannot be reproduced identically in Muds- but it
attempts to faithfully recreate the atmosphere as closely as possible, with
many people and places from several of Carroll's works included.

NOTE- a LOT of the flavor and fun of this area will be lost if the triggers
are not present or functioning properly, so if you are going to use this
area on any other mud than AnonyMud! i would suggest you write appropriate
mob_progs or endeavour to modernize your mud with the truly brilliant
trigger code by the coders at AnonyMud!

Enjoy!

Yaegar, October 1996.

alice~
Alice~
Alice raises her eyebrows and says "Curiouser and curiouser!"
~
In her amazement she has completely forgotten proper English. As if the
inrecdible sights of Wonderland weren't enough, now she has encountered you,
a strange being clad in dozens of different types of armor with no regard for
fashion. Small wonder she is both amazed and afraid of you!

white rabbit~
a white rabbit~
A smartly dressed white rabbit scurries by, muttering to himself.
~
"I'm late! I'm late!" he seems to be saying, which is impossible as rabbits
don't talk. Or do they? He was certainly very well dressed for a rabbit, or
for anyone for that matter. Perhaps you'd fancy acquiring some of his
accoutrements? After all, how hard could he be to slay?

A mouse is struggling to keep afloat here.

The mouse is swimming, with some difficulty, to the edge of this pool of
water. He looks startled upon seeing you approach, and cautiously demands
to know whether you are a cat.

A duck waddles about, looking very confused.

dodo~
a dodo~
A dodo is busy arranging some sort of foot race.
~
He is in fact arranging a caucus-race, to help everyone get dry. It seems to
consist of everyone gathering about in a circular shape ("the exact shape doesn't
matter") and running about until they are quite dry.

a lory~
A lory is busily racing about to dry off.
~
The lory is feeling rather sulky, as it feels that as the oldest present
(though it will NOT reveal its age) it knows best and should be in charge.

an eaglet~
An eaglet screeches and stretches its soaking wet wings.

An owl prepares to join in the caucus race.
~
This owl is quite young and not very wise as yet, so it is deferring to the
wisdom of the older birds and engaging in the decidedly silly caucus race.

a Cheshire Cat~
A Cheshire Cat smirks at you.
~
Smirking and grinning seem to be the only expressions this feline is
capable of. You weren't aware that cats could grin; then again, you've never
met a Cheshire Cat before. It has an irritating habit of making parts of
itself invisible, leaving only a tail, head or just a grin floating eerily
in the air.

Everything this insane man says is nonsense, though you do find it rather
amusing. He tells you of the time he had to sing at a concert given by
the Queen, where he performed "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat"-

"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
 How I wonder what you're at!

 Up above the world you fly,
 Like a tea-tray in the sky."

 Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!

Since they decided to freeze time at Six O'clock to save the Hatter's head,
it has always been tea-time, with no time to wash up. So they alternate
seats and serving sets. The Hare wants you to tell them a story now.

sisters, treacle and treacle wells. It really doesn't make much sense, but
the Dormouse gets irritated if interrupted, so you patiently listen.

This fellow is perhaps at the same time both the busiest and the least-busy

hundreds of people, he never actually carries out the task. He is currently
attempting to figure out a way to decapitate the head of the Cheshire Cat
from... nothing. Such are the weird ways of Wonderland.

A Grassy Field~
You are standing in a rather pleasant green field, by the banks of a softly
flowing brook. To the east, you can see a small hedge row, beneath which you
think you can make out a rabbit hole. Suddenly, a rabbit dashes past,
muttering something about being late, and disappears down the hole! Oddly
enough, it has a pocket watch, and you have never seen a rabbit with a 
watch. You are inspired to investigate!

The Rabbit Hole~
You are falling down a rabbit hole, unlike any you have ever seen in your
life! The walls are lined with shelves filled with jars of many different
substances. And though you are falling without restraint, you do not feel
that it will cause you any injury upon impact.

The Bottom of the Hole~
After falling for what seemed like at once forever and hardly any time at
all, you reach the bottom, landing with a soft thump. To the east stretches
a long corridor lined with lamps and locked doors. You see the rabbit
disappear around a corner and leap up to give chase, though you don't know
why.

drop something on the way. You hear what sounds like water lapping against
the edge of a pool to the far north.

Garden~
You emerge into a garden, near a cucumber patch. It looks as if someone has
recently fallen into this patch, squashing a great deal of it. You hear the
rabbit shouting something from outside.

On the Edge of the Wood~
You move away from the house, staring back in amazement at the hive of
activity. A small cart full of ladders and ropes has been pulled up, and
several animals are scurrying about, trying to see if you are still in the
house. The rabbit has gone again, doubtless still attempting to make his
appointment.

A Mushroom~
The path is divided here by a huge mushroom, large enough for you and a few
friends to sit on. It is currently home to someone else, though. The path
continues around it to the east.

At the Base of a Tree~
You pass by a particularly tall tree to the north, from which you can hear
someone shouting "Serpents! Serpents!" at the top of their lungs. The path
continues into the wood to the east and west.

of several broad branches.

The Top~
You reach the top of the tree, poking your head through a thick layer of
leaves and branches to peer out across a canopy of the same that stretches
as far as you can see. The sun beats down upon your face, the heat warming
and cleansing you. A bird's nest rests in the canopy near your head.

Outside the Duchess' House (Pig and Pepper)~
You are standing outside a little house, in an open field. From within you
can hear what sounds like a pig squealing and plates being smashed. Your
nose twitches, twice, and you realize that it is being irritated by a
strong odor of pepper, emanating from within.

A Large Kitchen~
The door opens directly onto the kitchen of this place, which is filled with
smoke. Several people are moving about in here, most of them sneezing as you
are due to the pepper that can be smelled everywhere. A grinning cat sits
at the feet of the duchess, and its smirk unsettles you
