Lord Tarrant~
A thin, haggard figure strides forth from the darkness.
~
The soul of Lord Tarrant was cursed by the witch to be bound to this
plane, and has in its rage become a revenant, thirsting for vengeance.
Were Tarrant to know the witch to be slain, he could at last rest, with
the rest of his kinfolk.
 
A mighty sorcerer as well as a formidable swordsman, Tarrant is a foe worthy
of respect for any perpetrator of evil deeds.

An enormous black dragon lies curled up in the cave.

Dengraz'ch is a formidable drake, one of the many terrors inflicted on
the hapless village of Gilchrist by the Necromancer. He answers to none
but The Necromancer, not even to the witch or her cabal, who hate and
fear him. While he is of unfathomable evil, he is not overtly violent,
and will not attack obviously capable adventurers without provocation-
past experience has taught him not to underestimate these disarmingly
frail-looking creatures.

Darkness Falls~
The narrow path is composed of crumbling flagstones, partially overgrown
with decayed weeds where it borders the rolling fields to either side.
Running southwards, it descends down the gentle side of a small tor, at
the base of which rests the village of Gilchrist. To the east, winking
lights mark Heddick's Bluff, and the manor of the Baron DuChesne. To the
west the ominous outline of the Hillside Cemetary umbrages the horizon,
its ugly protrustion casting a shadow over the valley. Although the visage
is peaceful and quiet, it is a little too quiet... no birds chirp in the
gnarled trees, no animals scamper through the grass, which is stained an
unpleasant brown. Light from sun and moon is obscured by heavy overhanging
clouds, tinged with an angry purplish shade. The air is still, and humid,
as before a thunderstorm. The pervading aura of gloom would appear to
lend credence to the purported curses laid upon this place by agents of
the dark power known only as the Necromancer.

A Quiet Journey~
The path continues, wending its way ribbonlike down the slope of the
grassy hill. Trees of various types have burst sporadically through
the soil to either side over the centuries, making the sloping terrain
resemble a patchwork quilty of green and brown shades. Twisted, gnarled
things, they loom menacingly like the footsoldiers of some army of flora.
The cobblestones shift underfoot occasionally, evidence of insufficient
maintenence.

The Valley Floor~
After several hundred yards the path flattens out as it reaches the
valley floor, which houses Gilchrist, nestled between the surrounding
hills, ostensibly secure in their protective earthen embrace. The 
hills to either side bear the other noteworthy landmarks of the valley,
and to the north a junction marks the point where disparate roads rise
to meet these destinations.

A Meeting of Paths~
At this point the valley path is met by another trail, running west
towards the base of the forbidding hill that houses Hillside cemetary,
the cursed resting place of the restless dead. Since the coming of the
Witch and her curse, none have dared venture any nearer this former 
site of rememberence and respect. Agents of the Necromancer abound in
these lands, it would seem. The trees near here shift slightly, as if
troubled by a breeze, though the air remains quite still. A chill tinges
the air, enough to warrant an extra cloak, and the faint stench of death
drifts ever so slightly from the west.

Precariously perched atop one of the many hills that surround the
valley, Hillside cemetary could not have been more appropriately
named. The blackened metal gates are visible at the end of this
long and winding path that winds up the side of the hill, towards
the entrance to the haunted graveyard. Lightning flashes along the

The Base of the Hill~
Hillside cemetary has been in place for so long that the locals have
not really used the name of the hill upon which it rests for decades.
Known as Rannu's Tor, it is the tallest hill in the region, and the
effort required to carve the path into its side that begins here was
extensive. Rannu was a hero born in this region, who rose centuries 
ago to cast down the dread tyrant Xarad-Bar'qh, slaying him and his
many minions before perishing himself at the hands of the tyrant's
concubines. However, that is ancient history to those of Gilchrist, 
who simply refer to the hill as Hillside, when they rarely broach the
subject of the cursed graveyard.

folk to lay the evil presence to rest have never returned...

and scarred, as if by red hot hands grasping and rending at them. The

Numerous body parts have been thrust onto the metal spikes that line the
ornate game, partially obscuring the name- HILLSIDE CEMETARY.

The Unholy Sanctuary of the Desecrated Chapel~
The darkened interior of the chapel reeks of death and decay, and is
filled with an almost overwhelming evil presence that even the most
ignorant could not help but detect. Stains cover the walls, of various
substances, mostly unmentionable. The shattered windows admit driving
rain, a sign that the storm you sighted earlier has finally struck.

The Umbraged Chapel~
A foulness fills the air of the chapel, a certain malevolence not easily
quantifiable. It is more than the corpses lying amongst the pews, more
than the bloodstains covering the walls, more than the mutilated bodies
hanging from the scorched rafters, depositing the occasional piece of
burnt flesh. It is a presence, as of some dark force that was defiling 
soul as well as body and mind. Shattered remnants of various religious
objects tell the tale of the sorry fate suffered by the worshippers who
were caught here when the evil arrived, doubtlessly minions of the fell
Necromancer. Without a doubt, the rumors of his machinations are proved
by what has transpired within this chapel.

Dark stains, marking the point where wounded victims attempted to

cover the once-white walls, a grim reminder of the unpleasant fate
suffered by those whose bodies litter the chapel. A thick stench 
causes constant discomfort, although it is not as bad here as in the
central worship area. Scrawlings and scribblings cover the walls here
scribed in blood by some deranged man.

The bulk of this wing of the chapel has been filled with bodies, piled
high for some unfathomable purpose. Most of them are in various stages
of decay, and show signs of having been at least partially devoured
over the last few weeks, as if some beast pauses to nibble every now
and again on the protruding pieces of flesh. Faces agape in visages of
pure terror, these unfortunates have been damned, their souls taken
as easily as their bodies.

The end of the chapel bears the most sickening sight of all- an altar,
formerly devoted to law and goodness, now corrupted to serve as a
tool in the worship of dark powers. Surely those of an evil persuasion
would revel in such a flagrant defilement of this icon of benevolence.
Blood covers the altar, as well as the walls, and the staked corpses
affixed to the wall gaze down at the altar in sheer horror; at least
as best they can- their eyes have exploded in their heads, one of the
many fates they suffered as they perished, horribly, at this altar.

The Subterranean Catacombs~
A low-ceilinged tunnel lies here, running beneath the chapel, undoubtedly
to various tombs and storage rooms. Most churches of this region bear
similar underground tombs; indeed, many of the saints are interred beneath
the altars of churches and cathedrals. Past nobility and others of means
would have been buried in specially constructed crypts, spaced along the
twisting tunnels that honeycomb through the hill. The air here is foul, as
would be expected, though there is more than the stale stench of such tombs.
Something evil.

A narrow, dusty crawlspace runs behind the false wall, heading into
the darkness, presumably towards the final resting place of someone
of import. Why the tomb has been concealed thusly thus far remains
a mystery. Cobwebs fill the shadowed ceiling, of which very little 
can be seen. Several pairs of footprints in the thick dust covering
the floor indicates someone has been here recently...

The Resting Place of Lord Tarrant~
The stairs end some thirty feet down in a cavernous chamber, the walls
of which are lined with unlit torches thrust into metal sconces, set 
at regular intervals around the perimeter. In between each sconce hangs
a portrait, of knights of ages past. Above each portrait hangs a coat 
of arms of that knight's house, a mark of respect to the knight and to
his house. Piles of corroded weapons lie atop moldering clothing below
each picture; the remains of the knight's battle garb, worn so bravely
in life and now left to rot in death. Of their bodies, though, there is
no sign. Only a single coffin can be seen in the room, placed in the 
center of the chamber, atop a stone plinth. It is from this coffin that
the breeze, and the sounds it carries, appears to emanate...

Long stone passages beckon, rife with the evil infestation that has
cast such a pall over the valley. Surely one need look no further for
ample evidence of the Necromancer's black hand reaching out over this
region. His minions abound, pursuing their insane, nihilistic plans
to thrust the world into eternal darkness. Howls and screams, expected
in this fell domain, echo down the greasy stone halls.

At one stage a quiet research area used by the priests, this chamber
has been usurped and converted to a not dissimilar function, though
the texts now researched here would cause the eyes of a priest to
explode in their sockets, followed closely by their brains. Dark tomes
of ancient origin line a wooden shelf set in the west wall; a reddish
glow suffuses them, indicating the presence of a magical forcefield,
to deter unwanted perusal- as if the very fact that reading most of 
these tomes leads to agonizing death was not enough.

those who pass, as if the disturbed souls of the restless dead seek
to exact their vengeance at this final insult.

yet were taken over by the agents of the Necromancer in a mere matter 
of hours. What became of those interred here is unclear, though there is
the grim possibility that many of them now roam the catacombs as the

Once a tomb of an ancient knight, the contents of this chamber have
been cast out, and replaced with a long desk, laden with piles of
parchment covered in black runes and sigils. A dull humming sound
arises from them, accompanied by the occasional low moan. The air is
thick with the stench of brimstone, and the blood that forms the
pentagram on the floor seethes and bubbles, as if it were boiling.
The naked corpse of an unfortunate villager lies drained of blood
in one corner. This is obviously the chambers of the cabal's leader.
But where is the Witch? Or her master, the Necromancer?

This fouled hole, partially filled with broken bones and rubble, is 
heavy with the stench of death and decay. Putrescent chunks of flesh
lie half-devoured over the floor, amidst bloodstains and puddles of
other substances. Despite the filth, the lair may hold something of
interest, for it is here that the ghouls store their booty...

The first thing you see as you rashly pass through the gateway is a
vast plain, of red soil, which appears to be on fire... As you pause to
consider how dirt could possibly burn, your attention is diverted by a
roar, and a wave of heat as a monstrous wall of flame engulfs you,
reducing to to a charred stain in seconds.

The Eastern Path~
The road travels eastward, heading directly for the base of the bluff
that harbors the residence of the Baron. The twinkling lights of the
village of Gilchrist are visible to the northeast, past a row of low,
sloping hillcocks that the path ribbons through. The air is still,
and bereft of the animal noises one who travels such roads is normally
accustomed to.

Another Junction~
Here the road to the east is met by a broad trail that leads north
to the outskirts of Gilchrist, barely visible from here. Horse sign
marks the trail here, gouging the soft earth that lies to either side
of the flagstones, indication of large forces of mounted knights that
have moved through the area. In fact, the distant approach of a rider
can be detected, his steed's hooves clattering on the stone.

Approaching the Manor~
The path rises sharply to the east here, ascending sharply to the
summit of the bluff, where the manor of Baron DuChesne looks out 
over the valley his family is sworn to rule and defend. A dark
pall hangs in the air, and the sense of being watched by some foul
presence is strong. The palpable stench of death is strong in the
air, as is the odor of fresh blood.

The Bluff~
From this vantage, one has a clear view of the valley and its surrounds,
including the twinkling lights of Gilchrist to the northwest. It is the
village that the Baron holds dear, and is sworn to defend. His current
inability to do so pains him; perhaps he would be grateful to those who
would purge the valley of the menace of the Necromancer... very grateful?
The imposing manor of the baron lies east of here, set back from here.

A Narrow Path~
This path has been trampled by horse hooves and booted feet, flattened
so as to be even and unmarked by potholes, though a recent rain has
left grooves along the side where the water ran off. Once lush trees
to the sides of the road appear sickly and frail; some of this could
be blamed on the season and climate, but there's more to it than that;
the evil of the Necromancer has tainted this land, perhaps irrevocably.

The red stone structure that houses the Baron and his house lies to

the front of the house is visible; glass windows looking out from the

cart without horses, for the Baron, stands near the entrance, as does
a white stone statue, sans arms, which stands in the middle of the
garden. The house is quite stately, and well kept despite these dark

dealing with all manner of subjects. Works on Law, Art and Government 
line some shelves, while treatises on Witchcraft, the Occult and even
Demonology fill the shelf nearest the chair the Baron sits in when he
is reading. Apparently he has been researching his enemy exhaustively, 
in an attempt to find a way to defeat him. A roaring blaze in the fire

This chamber is dominated by a massive table that could seat thirty,
which is, like the rest of the furniture in this room, covered with 
white cloth. The Baron has had little cause to celebrate since the
darkness that has claimed the land (and took his family), and thus
it has remained unused for months. Crystal chandeliers hang from the
rafters, and could illuminate the chamber for hours, though the task
of lighting them would take hours. A door to the north leads to the

Once an orderly kitchen where scores of meals were prepared, the
kitchens have been transformed into a scene of bloody murder. Some
vile creature has managed to infiltrate the Baron's manor, and then
secreted itself in here, massacring all that enter, until it gets a
chance to strike at the Baron. Blood, some of it fresh, coats every
available surface, while gutted corpses hang from meat hooks on the
ceiling, blood and gore dripping onto the floor. A basket of severed
heads sits near the door, while a pile of dismembered limbs fills the
preparation tables, many of them speared with knives and forks. The
stench is horrid, and assaults your nostrils. Woe to whoever else may
enter this kitchen, for the beast responsible for this will quickly
dismember them as it has everyone else, and add you to its grisly and
stinking collection.

and the sleeping area of the Baron and what remains of his family.
However, the knights have barricaded the stair, at the Baron's request
as he no longer wishes to revisit the scene of the slaughter of his
family by a Nek'rabeast. He spends all of his time in the library, as
he attempts to find a way to defeat this menace.

Approaching Gilchrist, you cannot help but notice how bare the streets

fallen into disrepair; the cynical would say that the soul has been
torn from these pathetic creatures. A kinder soul would seek a way to
mend the damage done to them, and an avaricious soul may well wonder
what sort of reward the Baron would offer if someone dispelled this
threat to his people.

The streets of this small village are a scene of dark depression. The
villagers that move about are sullen and without any happiness; the
Necromancer has taken the lives of most of their loved ones, most
foully slaying all their children to break their morale. And on top
of all of this, their Baron appears to have failed them, having been
unable to put an end to the evil that plagues their town.

aimlessly through the streets.

been slain or moved away. Evidently the battle against the Necromaner
has already been lost, as far as these villagers are concerned.

waste to most of the land surrounding Gilchrist, and will eventually
do the same to the rest of the valley, turning into the nightmarish
realm their master desires. Several spears have been thrust into the
earth beside the path here; atop them have been perched the severed
heads of slain knights, their mouths agape in their rotting faces; a
foul stench exudes from this grim warning. The knights still have atop
their heads their plumed helms, stained with blood and gore.

Necromancer would move so boldly against an Imperial holding; perhaps

A narrow ledge near the peak of a forbidding, blackened spire is the
only secure foothold before the blackened steel gates that loom to
the east of you. Lightning crackles about the towering dark spires
that rise from the keep the gate guards, and rolling thunder that
echoes among the surrounding mountains does little to ease your mind.
Shadowy shapes flit about the towering walls, smooth and without a 
single foothold that would allow anyone to scale them. To the west, a
yawning chasm surrounds the peak, a certain death for any foolish enough
to step in that direction, for the strong winds that gust around the 
peak would dash even a flying traveller to pieces against the sharp stone.
There can be no doubt that this is the abode of the Necromancer, and his
minions. This may well be the last chance to pull out, for once inside
the walls of his keep, it is unlikely escape will be easy...

The ominous metal gates open onto a dark courtyard, overshadowed by
the looming spire that lies to the east. Not a soul can be seen on
the walls; no guards patrol the perimeter, nor keep watch. An eerie
whistling sound, caused by the wind passing through holes in the dark
inner walls, sets your teeth on edge. A metal trapdoor is set in the
stone floor, housing a dungeon no doubt, and whatever else a mad
necromancer may be inspired to keep. Flashes of lightning reveal a 
little of the gothic architecture of this place; in some ways it is
almost beautiful in its terrible aspects; grinning gargoyles flank 
each entrance, while intricate carvings of scenes of debauchery cover
the walls.

your vision blurring as you sink into a sleep you will never awaken

Haven of the Cult~
Those most favored of the dark cult of the Necromancer are invited to
his dark world, and bid to serve him in what manner he sees fit; most
commonly as sacrificial victims. However, certain cultists, notably
the Witch Tus'schepteba, rise through the ranks to become close and
trusted advisors, though this service is often of a brief duration as
the Necromancer knows well the treachery ambition breeds. He himself
became master of this realm by slaying his mentor. The dark chamber
they are bid to reside in boasts no furnishings or food; the cultists
survive on pure faith alone.

Lair of the Wyrm~
Vile, inculcable evil awaits behind every door in this fell domain,
it seems. For the foul grotesque that lairs in here defies any real
description; it is a wyrm, though not a dragon, draconian, but too
reptillian. The venom that drips from its long barbed tail has scored
the stone, and the many skeletons that umbrage the dusty ground under
foot. What must that acidic compound do to exposed flesh...

The Top of the Shaft~
The shaft ends here, at a flat ceiling lined with sharp spikes, which
you have to move slowly to avoid. Venom drips from their tips, as if
they were the spines of some chaotic beast... it is best not to spend
time contemplating such things. A plain wooden door, unremarkable in
all ways, is visible, set into the north wall; there is no ledge in
front of it, you will have to fly to it and soar through, before your
enchantment atrophies and you plummet to your death, with very little
abrogating circumstances.

The Base of a Stair~
The door opens onto a seemingly innocuous chamber. It is dark, true,
and the grim sense of foreboding is still present, but the walls are
solid, cool to the touch but dry and firm, and there are no demonic
creatures awaiting you... It would appear you are past the worst of
it. Or are you? A stone stair ascends to a corridor of gray stone up
above, which seems to shift ever so slightly under your scrutiny...
A trick of the light, perhaps?

A Fleshy Corridor~
The walls of this corridor are of stone, but shift and flex as if they
were made of some amorphous substance, namely stone colored flesh. A
vile smell assaults your nostrils, an unmistakable odor of death and
decay. Even the darkest soul would find it hard to continue; not out
of disgust, but out of fear and respect for the terrible master of a
domain as foul as this. Surely nothing mortal could subsist in such a
place?

A Dead End... of Sorts.~
The fleshy corridor ends here, spewing its contents into a blackwalled
section of corridor that boasts a single wooden door, covered in vile
runes, and a shimmering black portal, the only other exit, though it
would be inadvisable to continue by that direction unless one was well
and truly prepared to face something out of a demon's nightmares. A
vile smell, of scorched flesh and blood, wafts in from the east; this
odor is not foreign to those used to the battlefield, but it is so
strong and pervasive here that even a veteran of the Chaos Wars may 
well balk.

The Laboratory of the Witch~
This foul workplace contains unspeakable experiments, combining the
sciences of alchemy and surgery with the magical arts of Evocation
and Necromancy. The result is a twisting, writhing mass of flesh in
several large glass beakers, that will be ground up and consumed by
the horrid minions of the Necromancer, to grant them all unspeakable 
powers and abilities. This workplace is an abomination to some, a
great find to others.

A Nightmarish Reality~
The portal opens onto a scene out of the darkest nightmares of the
truly damned. The walls of the chamber here appear to be made of
flesh; mottled, grey flesh covered with pustelent sores, the foul
discharge affording scant purchase to those endeavouring to cross
the slick, blubbery floor. Howls and screams echo around the chamber,
their source apparently souls trapped in this fleshy tomb, desperate
to feed on the living. But the worst of the abominations lies ahead...

Flesh of Sin~
The passage ends in a dense, impenetrable mound of mottled flesh,
crawling with parasites and dripping ichor from a thousand small
sores. The ghastly odor that issues forth from this abomination 
is almost as horrid as the fact that this creature is a sentient
being, and capable of dark misdeeds. Constructed from the flayed
remains of a thousand sinners, this spawn of chaos has existed 
here for centuries, patiently awaiting the arrival of enemies of
its dark creator.

The Heart of Evil~
Clambering through the gaping wound in the fleshy wall feels to a 
disconcerting degree much like crawling into a festering wound on
someone's body. Blood cakes the blubbery walls and floor, and the
ceiling drips with ichor. Vaguely humanoid forms crawl about in
the fleshy walls, straining to break free, their hands pushing at
the soft mottled grey flesh. The floor oozes various disgusting
fluids, and a vile stench fills the whole chamber. A bloody orifice
to the north leads to the end of the passage...

The Final Enemy~
The walls of this blood soaked chamber are strewn with atrophied limbs,
some still feebly clutching, fused to the wall by unfathomable dark
magicks. Blood oozes from sores on their mottled grey flesh, coalescing
in pools at the base of the fleshy walls, where gaping, toothy maws
gulp hungrily at it- the sucking sound of these disembodied mouths is
maddening. The roof is lined with heavy chains, from which hang the
limbless trunks the wall decorations were torn from. Some of these souls
moan in pain and rage, hanging on barbed hooks, twisting in a ghostly 
breeze that blows in from an unknown destination. It seems unbelieveable
that someone could possibly reside in such a diabolic sanctum...

The End of the Path~
An ancient sage, his name escapes you, once said that of all the many
abodes of all creatures within the realms of mortals, no home is more
easily identifiable than that of a dragon. Surely that same man could
not have hope for a better example than the dank cave you have passed
into. You aren't sure if its the string of decomposing bodies swaying
in the wind where they hang from iron hooks, or perhaps the deep scar
in the wall where the drake sharpens its death-dealing claws. In fact
even the massive pile of treasure that fills the back half of the dim
lair is not the single conclusive clue. It is a combination of all of
this. and more; whatever the reason, you are sure that your lives are
now in dire jeopardy...
