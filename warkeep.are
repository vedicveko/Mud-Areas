0 'The Keep of the Warlock'~
Many centuries ago, around the time of the Goblin Wars, which took the lives
of so many Elves, Dwarves and Humans on the Plains of Blood, there existed
a vile and crafty warlock named Baragar, and he resided in a fell keep
near the jagged peak of Mount Doom. By traveling to the past dimension, you
will have the chance to meet and slay this evil mercenary who worked against
his own race for the money of foul forces such as Krogthar, Jher and Lord
Vax. The warlock is not alone in his keep, however, and you will find
yourself pitted against many heinous foes in your journey.

warlock baragar~
the warlock Baragar~
The warlock Baragar chuckles at you and dares you to attack him.
~
Before you stands the master of the keep, Baragar the warlock. And while
Baragar is weak compared to sorcerers such as Krogthar and his minions,
or the vile Jher, he is no pushover either.

Baragar is a handsome young man with long white hair, and deep blue eyes.
He would appear to be almost angelic were it not for the diabolical gleam
to his eyes, and the evil grin on his thin, cruel lips.

the witch Alara~
A comely woman in her early twenties grins at you.
~
This woman is the witch Alara, associate and lover of Baragar. She is nude
save for a leather bandolier across her chest and buttocks, which contains
a variety of potions, scrolls and throwing daggers. She would be very
attractive if she didn't cackle insanely so much.

a demon~
A minor demon hisses and snarls at you.
~
Baragar and Alara managed to capture this demon and keep it in this room,
but they lacked the power necessary to control it, so they dare not release
it again. And now you're in here with this eight foot tall, four armed,
green skinned monstrosity from the lower planes. Great.

a zombie servant~
A zombie servant gazes at you blankly.
~
This poor fellow was once a living servant of Baragar who made one mistake
too many. Baragar eventually decided undead staff were far more reliable,
if a little slower, and slew all his staff, turning them subsequently into
mindless undead. That's what a charming guy he is.

A keep guard stands rigidly at attention here.
~
This guard is slightly bemused at your entrance, but doesn't move to stop
you- Baragar receives dozens of visitors daily, and if they are powerful
enough to slay him, then the guards certainly don't stand a chance, so they
keep quiet. You may wonder why in that case Baragar bothers having guards.
Well, so does he.

The Path to the Keep~
You are heading toward a bleak blackstone keep, sitting in the middle of
a field of scorched earth. Surly guards patrol both on the battlements and
below before the gate, but they pay you little heed. Evidently the guards
are used to strange visitors...

The Roof of the Tower~
You emerge onto the roof of the tower. From here you can see far across the
plains of Past Anon. The ancient city of Thalos, ruined in your own time,
lies far to the south, while to the east lie the jagged peaks of the first
mountain range of Anon. It is rumored that the gods temselves reside at their
lofty peaks. Beyond them, you can see the peak of Mount Doom, whereupon
the castle of the dread Lord Krogthar is located.

servants appear to be rather lifeless and cold...

Baragar's Chambers~
Baragar himself resides here, in this small room. It is rather spartan,
furnished only with a small military cot, a desk and a shelf full of books.
You are surprised that such a wicked man would be so neat and disciplined.

Alara's Chamber~
Yang to Baragar's Yin, Alara's room represents just how different they are.
Her room is sloppy and messy, filled with useless junk and piles of unwashed
clothing. There are two large beds, covered with expensive silks and pillows.
A set of manacles hangs from one wall, used for some perversion you don't
care to find out more about.

but when one spell summoned a denizen of the lower planes that they couldn't
control, they hastily sealed it in this room. And now you have released it.
Way to go.

You are at a rather busy junction in the dungeons. To the north runs a dark
passage, while to the south lies a door. To the west lies the source of
the noises you heard earlier. it is obvious that a team of workers is
excavating down here. Perhaps Baraga wishes to unearth the treasures
rumored to lie in the ancient caverns beneath his keep...?

A Lab~
This room was once used as a lab, but Baragar grew bored with alchemy,
and abandoned it. Eventually a Grell from the lower caverns made its way
up here, and created a nest in this lab. Baragar was fascinated by the
bizarre creature, and sealed it within, intending one day to study it. He
occasionally feeds it the odd slave or guard.

You are standing on the roof, atop the highest point of the whole keep.
The lands of Past Anon lay spread out before you, and from this windswept
position you can see for miles. You hear the cry of some bird, and look
above to see several vultures slowly winging their way toward the desolate
deserts to the south. In those deserts there is rumored to be a fantastic
place filled with wondrous treasures.
