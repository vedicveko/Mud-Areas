Entrance to the Rain Forest~
You are stunned as you look at the wonders before you.  Lush, 
green vegetation towers high above you.  You hear the screeches, and 
other noises of the forest.  This trail is said to lead to the Amazon 
River, but who knows where it really leads.  The trail appears to be 
unmarked, and you realize quick that you must pay attention, or you will 
get lost.  The trail is muddy, and the trees are dripping with water.  
The fresh smell of summer rain draws you closer.  North takes you into 
the Rain Forest.

You are now standing on a long winding trail in the Rain Forest.  The 
sounds of the forest surround you, and you are amazed by the beauty that 
is lying before you.  There is a small river flowing alongside the trail, 
and plenty of birds, and insects.

Trail in the Rain Forest~
The trail is very moist, and wet, and it is evident that a lot of
rain falls here.  The mud sometimes gets deep, and is hard to walk 
through.  The rain allows many species of plants and animals to live 
here, and alot of them are only found in this forest.  It is a very rare, 
and special place, hopefully it will be left alone so that future 
generations may see its beauty.

Trail in the Rain Forest~
As you walk along the muddy, dirt path, you notice that you just
keep getting deeper and deeper into the jungle.  Swirls of bright colors 
keep your eyes busy, and your mind off of the obvious dangers that lie 
ahead.  Lions, and Tigers, and Bears.... just maybe.  As you look 
straight ahead, you see a large mountain towering over you in the 
distance.  As you look at the ground, you see large tracks, and try to 
think of what animal could own them.

Trail in the Rain Forest~
The trees seem to have a break in them here, and form some sort of gap 
that leads through the forest.  The best idea would be to stay on the 
path you are on, and you choose to do so.  The rain from the trees 
trickles down, and lands softly on your face.  What could possibly be 
ahead of here?

Trail in the Rain Forest~
You now see a small brook, and little log bridge.  The water is 
only about a foot deep, and is moving very slowly.  It's the type of 
place where you could just sit all day and think about your life, and 
your travels.  A place to clear your mind, and meditate.  The bridge is 
only about 2 feet off the water, and you feel the water splash your heels 
as you cross it.

Trail in the Rain Forest~
You are now far away from civilization, and the bridge almost seemed 
to seperate the forest realm from civilization.  The brush is now getting 
more dense, and the plant life is overwhelming.  The plants seem to move 
in rhythm to your footsteps.  It's almost as if they feel your earthly 
presence entering their realm.

You find yourself very deep in the jungle.  The dense brush now 
seems to completely surround you on all sides.  You still see the vast 
white mountain in front of you, and the sound of rushing water keeps 
getting more familiar to your ears.  You see a clearing a ways in front 
of you, maybe a nice break from the forest.  You think it might be a good 
place to stop and eat lunch.

many varieties of tropical fruits growing in the trees here.  The trail 
continues onward into the jungle.

What if you are lost, what if no one can hear your screams? 
Pulses racing, shrieking, nothing can help you here.  Scream at the top 
of your lungs, it will do you no good, the creatures of the forest will 
drown you out.  Do not distract Mother Nature, or there will be hell 
to pay.

Deep in the Jungle~
You are beginning to be convinced that there is nothing to be found in 
this jungle.  Actually, there are many things, they are just well hidden 
away from wandering eyes.  The sounds of the forest surround you, yet you 
see nothing but trees, and rain.  The sound of twigs snapping awakens 
your senses.

A flock of Macaws flies by you, and colors fill your eyes.  The 
colors seem to go in all directions, and spread out.  The beauty of the 
rain forest surrounds you.  It seems like the perfect place to live in 
peace.  The only thing is, who knows what is all around you.  The fear of 
the unknown is the only problem that you would have here.  What lies deep 
in the jungle, far away from mortal eyes?  You see a small path of dirt, 
and what appears to be a large opening just ahead.

You are now standing on a small patch of dirt.  There appears 
to be a cliff just ahead.  On the other side of the cliff, you see 
mountains towering over you in the distance.  You can't see down right 
now, but you assume by the height of the mountains, and trees on the 
other side that the cliff is going to be very high, and very dangerous.

Before the Cliff~
You are getting closer, and closer to the edge of the cliff.  The 
edge of the cliff is just up ahead.  You should be careful of loose rocks 
here, as the edge is only a few feet away.  Maybe turning back now 
wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Who knows what lies beneath the cliff, and 
who wants to fall to find out.  If you are afraid of heights and can't 
fly, then this is no place for you to be.  Then again, there may be some 
other way down the cliff, it's too hard to tell right now.

On the Cliff's Edge~
You find yourself standing on a huge cliff.  The rocks on the
cliff are wet, and slippery, better not get too close to the edge.  As 
you look down, all you can see is water, and more water.  The mighty 
Amazon flows swiftly far below, and goes as far as the eye can see.  You 
see small footholds that lead down the edge of the cliff, perhaps 
evidence that some primitive people existed here long ago.  Down leads to 
the bottom of the cliff, and south leads back into the jungle.  You see a 
small trail that leads off by itself to the west.

The Cliffside~
You are now hanging off the side of the cliff climbing down the 
small footholds that are all along the wall of the cliff.  Don't look 
down now, there's still a long ways to go before you get to the bottom.  
It's still hard to see the bottom because of a small rock outcropping 
that blocks your vision below you.  The climb wouldn't be so bad if the 
footholds weren't so small, and the cliff wasn't so steep.  You see a
large mysterious mansion sitting on the edge of the cliff towering above
you to your east, it could be very dangerous there.

The Cliffside~
You are now past the rock outcropping, and almost at the bottom 
of the cliff.  You can see what looks like the remains of a city beneath 
you, and get excited as you realize that you might have found a lost 
city.  What ancient force could lie below you?  Could there be some 
undiscovered treasure, or some other beautiful sight, or could it be lost 
souls looking for revenge on the mortals that killed them?  You just 
never know what lies below you, and the warm stale air coming from below 
you draws you nearer.

The Lost City of Xisto~
You are now standing at the bottom of the cliff.  Broken piece of 
marble, and stone lie all around you.  This appears to be the remains of 
an ancient city that was ravaged by a war and destroyed.  Who knows what 
this ancient place could hold.  Maybe this place could hold the key to 
eternity, who knows.  You see monkeys all around you, and you wonder if 
they are protecting the city, and what lies within these ancient gates.

The Lost City of Xisto~
Walking along the wreckage, you see many strange gems and rocks.  
Wait a minute, they appear to be diamonds, or are they?  They might be, 
but you would have to look closer to find out, maybe you should pick one 
up.  This place could make you the richest person in all of the land.  
But what if some strange curse is protecting these diamonds?  What if 
some sacred deity doesn't want you to disturb his home.  You know that 
some things are better if left alone, especially if they are sacred.  You 
see a small stone door ahead of you that appears to lead to a bigger room.

Beneath the Remains~
The smell of death is in the air here.  Piles of bones line the
walls in this outdoor catacomb.  Thousands and thousands of skeletons are 
lying here, could they be mass burials from a war?  It's almost as if the 
shadows have eyes here.  It might be best if you leave this place.  
You hear cracking noises coming from the other end of the catacomb.  
The high stone walls obstruct your view on all sides, and the open ceiling 
only allows you to see the sky, and the mountains towering high above you.

The cracking noise keeps getting louder and louder.  The sound 
of cracking in a room full of bones isn't exactly something friendly.  
Your senses tell you that the best thing might be to get out of here 
quick.  There is always that part of the soul that has to push onward, 
and fight fear.  What if the cracking is just your imagination, after all 
there are bones everywhere.  What if it isn't?

The cracking sound has definitely become a reality.  A high pitched 
humming sound fills your senses as well.  What have you done, have you 
awakened the souls of the dead.  Do you hear them calling your name, or 
was that the wind?  You see a large gap in between a pile of bones, and a 
deep hole.  The cracking sound appears to be coming from the hole.  You
see a large pyramid towering over you now, it isn't that far away.

You are now standing in a pit about six feet below the ground.  
Six feet under I guess you could say.  There are piles of bones and 
bodies lying everywhere.  The cracking sound seems to have stopped, 
almost as if it hears you getting closer to it.  You wonder why these 
people never got proper burials as they should have.  It's almost as if 
something tells you that the spirits here are very unhappy.

A Shallow Pit~
Watch your step, be very careful.  The deadly Spikes on the ground 
could impale you easily if you fell on them.  They appear to be the rusty 
remains of some sort of ancient stone trap.  There is a strange red 
residue on the trap, it looks like hardened blood.  A soldier probably 
met his death here many years ago.  There might be some way for you to 
tell people about these bodies so they could get a proper burial, but 
then the secret of the lost city would be out.

very valuable and holy.  It's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk 
to open the chest and see what's inside.  Could the chest be locked, can 
you pick it, is it open?  A million things cross your mind as you wonder 
what could be inside.

The pit keeps getting narrower the further you go.  The walls are

insects start to crawl on you.  The spiders could be deadly, maybe you 
should turn back now.  This place reminds you of a place that you've seen 
in your nightmares.  The pit keeps getting narrower, and makes it seem 
like the walls are closing in on you.  Is that your imagination, or is 
there some deadly force playing with your soul?

squeeze your way through this narrow passage, and the light seems to be 
gone now.  It is nearly impossible to see now, and the only light is the 
slight amount that's coming from behind you.  The view ahead is 
obstructed by a sharp turn in the pit.  What lies on the other side of 
that turn is completely unknown.  It will be impossible to go much 
further in here, and maybe you should get out of here.

as you see the bones lying up against the wall animate and form a hideous 
monster.  It looks like you are trapped here forever, if you don't get 
out soon, the wall will crush you.  If the wall doesn't crush you, then 
the undead being here certainly will.  Your life flashes before your 
eyes, and your greed has now brought your demise.

You are now standing on the banks of the mighty Amazon River.  The 
water at the shore looks so deep that you can't see the bottom.  What 
lies beneath the depths of the mighty Amazon?  It is said that there are 
many hungry beasts that inhabit the river.  It is also said that the 
Spirit of the river will harm anyone that desecrates these waters.

You now find yourself floating in the largest river that you have ever 
seen.  The white mountain looms over the river, and casts its reflection 
in the dark, green water.  This is such a beautiful, peaceful place, yet 
you feel an almost overwhelming need to escape the grasp of the mighty 
river.  As you look beneath the surface of the murky green water, you can 
see for about three feet, but nothing deeper than that.  Creatures that 
no man has ever seen are said to lie in the mighty depths of the endless, 
winding river.  It is also said that many ancient, uncivilized tribes 
live on the banks of the river, and live off of its resources.

throughout the village.  You see a large bonfire in the distance.  When

circle reciting words unfamiliar to you.  Guessing that they might be 
offended if you disturbed their ritual, you decide to enter the village
