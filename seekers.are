Haven of the Seekers~
Before you rise the shining spires of the Haven of the Seekers, a
remote fortress nestled in the peaks of the Westhills. With its walls
of gleaming mithril and its intricately fashioned stained glass windows,
it is truly an object of wonder and beauty. Pilgrims used to come from 
all around to gaze upon its magnificence, but since the recent incursions
of Chaos its doors have remained closed to all save its members, a highly
dedicated select order of spellcasters and sages, all united in their desire
to obtain further knowledge, of the world and its inhabitants, and to provide
support for their fellow spellusers, a beleagured minority in these times.
To the north lies the golden gate, grand entrance to the Haven.
 
This lookout point is often used by Seekers as a place to meet with
non-members of the Order, and many times groups of adventurers will be
seen congregating here.

The Golden Gate~
Before you, set into the inpenetrable marble walls of the fortress, is
a massive gate, forged of gold imbued with supernatural energy which
renders it indestructible. Crafted by a god, only similar could breach it.
Seekers, and Seekers only, are permitted to pass by use of a special password,
which transports them through the gates and into the foyer of the Haven. All
others who attempt to enter may find themselves in less pleasing surrounds...
Far above, lightning crackles about one of the spires, evidence of magical
experiments taking place, or perhaps the arrival of an immortal or similar 
being seeking to witness the goings-on within these hallowed halls. The Gate
bears an inscription, written in all the known tongues of the Empire. It reads-
"Great is Knowledge, and Mighty Above all Things".

The Foyer of the Haven~
No matter how many times a Seeker enter their Haven, the vista that
greets them as they do never ceases to take their breath away. Massive
marble columns swathed in thick tendrils of ever blooming vines line
the marble hall, the floor of which is polished so perfectly that you
can see a clear reflection of yourself as you proceed. The towering
pillars support a high arched ceiling, over eighty feet high, which is
covered in richly colored murals depicting the founding of the Haven by
the gods of knowledge and learning, and the arrival of Telsar, first of the
Seekers in this holy place. Thick tapestries, woven from magical thread
by the Elves of Malathar, cover the walls, each of them bearing representations
of life, time, nature and the elements. The figures and places within them 
appear to be in a state of constant flux, as if they were living, breathing
material things, and not just an artistic representation. To the north the
Foyer meets the Halls of the Hallowed, which runs into the center of the
Haven. Truly there cannot be a more impressive structure in the world.

The Halls of the Hallowed~
Named for the marble statues of the most respected men and women of
learning in the history of the Empire, this colonnaded hall stretches
north towards the Glyph of Return, and south to the magnificent Foyer
of the Haven. Each statue is an incredibly lifelike depiction of those
most respected individuals of the Seekers, who have over the centuries
contributed most to the accumulation of knowledge and the discovery of
new magics and enchantments. Many of them are instantly familiar even to
the layman, while others are from an earlier period, the history of which
has been lost to most save those in the Order.

The Glyph of Return~
Engraved on the floor of this large chamber is a glowing rune, carved
into the rock by magical crystal which has left a glowing powdery residue
that causes the rune to glow with a bluish hue. By uttering the ancient
incantations of return known to all competent spellcasters, members of the
Order are drawn by this glyph to this chamber, a place of safety where they
can be certain of protection from outside forces. Passages run east and west
into other parts of the Haven, while the Halls of the Hallowed continue north
and south.

Hall of Destiny~
The walls here are of polished stone, and heavily decorated with
elaborate murals, depicting Seekers through the ages pursuing true
enlightenment through knowledge and combatting ignorance in all its varied
and insidious forms. Ignorance is perhaps one of the worst enemies one can
face; especially in a world fraught with constant peril, both mundane
and supernatural in origin. All Seekers are expected to combat ignorance
and misinformation, and to spread the joy of learning and expanding one's
skills and abilities to their fullest extent.

Chambers of Commerce~
This narrow hallway leads into the rooms set aside for members of the
Order to purchase goods and services necessary to their quests to 
increase their knowledge and magical power. While such services do
involve fees, the money that is gathered by these merchants is used to
further the Order, most notably in the addition of new structures and
services. The Seekers have also never claimed to be a non profit 
organization...

The Halls of the Hallowed~
Tapestries depicting the greatest finds in the history of the Seekers
decorate the walls here, ranging from the discovery of magic by the
earliest Seekers of magic, up to the development of advanced alchemical
formulae and complex magical rituals. Each has been lovingly and carefully
crafted from the finest cloth, and - due to either an innate enchantment or
clever weaving- the people in each tapestry appear to be moving and talking,
albeit no sound escapes their lips. On the ceiling, you see that transparent
metals forged by magical means have replaced the stone, allowing you to
see outside, as if on a clear summer's day.

The Arboretum~
Here the Hall enters a wide chamber filled with lush foilage, plants of
the greenest hue lining the walls, placed in neaty maintained beds of
fresh loam. The transparent ceiling affords them a great deal of sunlight,
and magical enchantments provide them with fresh clean water every second
day. Even a Druid from the Westwoods would be envious of the quality of
these plants. To the north, a short flight of steps leads up to a place
of rest and recuperation, tended by the kindly clerics of the Order.

The stairs end in a small circular chamber, the center of which is dominated
by a small statue placed in the middle of a fountain that bubbles with
fresh spring water. Benches surround this fountain on all sides, allowing
those who are tired or injured to rest and be tended to by Latasha, the
healer of the Order. Doric columns support the domed roof, which is decorated
with a richly colored mural that depicts the gods delivering blessings and
healings upon the populace.

This broad marble staircase ascends to the second level of the head-
quarters, where you can find the note boards, the donations room, the
dining area and the offices of the leaders. Only Seekers may ever pass
this way; if intruders somehow managed to penetrate thus far, they'd
receive little warmth from the Seekers if caught upstairs; the punishments
are said to be severe.

with shelving stacked with books covering a variety of subjects. Statues
of famed scholars, Seekers all, line the walls, some of them holding aloft
glowing balls of energy that serve as the primary source of illumination
here. A sense of awe comes over you as you stand in this hallowed hall
of learning and lore. Passages extend to the north, east and west, into
different sections of the sanctum, containing the upper echelons of
the Seekers, as well as equipment donations and communications areas.

The walls of this narrow stone corridor bear images of Seekers of all
races and ages delivering knowledge to the masses, whose faces are a
rapture of joy upon the bequethal of this precious gift. Also depicted
are Seekers exchanging items with each other, to further their quests
for knowledge and magic, and the bestowing of special gifts upon the
worthy members of the order by the Gods themselves. A bright light
shines in from the west, the glow of magical materials in abundance.

Chamber of the Philanthropist~
It is here that the Seekers leave items that they feel may be of use
to their fellow members, items that they no longer need but have in
their genorosity left for others to avail themselves of. While any
member is free to take items from the coffer, it is assumed that they
will repay in kind, either at the time or at a later date, by adding
something of similar value themselves. The order is a lawful one, but
is not a charity; members of the order who steal items from the coffer
to sell on the common market or to give to non-members often find themselves
outcast from the order, as do those wags that foolishly fill the coffer
with useless junk. The gods themselves are said to keep an eye on this
room.

Only the highest ranking members of the Seekers, and those they allow
to accompany them, may enter this chamber. Here, items of special power
or uniqueness are gathered and stored by the Order, to be distributed
amongst the members as the leaders see fit. Uusually the result of 
successful expeditions by the Seekers, these items are awarded to those
who have contributed to the order, in any form, and have thus deserved
a token of gratitude. Only the Keeper of the Relic can open the chest,
with the key granted him by the gods.

This north-south passage leads north to the chambers of the Order's
leaders, those three elected by the members of the Order to lead them
in their quest for knowledge, magical power and experience. The walls
bear depictions of leaders past and present, leading their peers against
dark magical threats, or on quests to find rare and exciting treasures.
The roof is covered with an intricately woven tapestry, often referred to
as the Tapestry of Life, wherein all the tales of the leaders are woven,
to be observed by future generations, a legacy left for their descendants.

Offices of the Prime Seekers~
The chamber off of which the offices of the Prime Seekers depend is
surprisingly bare, containing only the three doors, and a small fountain,
next to which a golden plaque has been placed. A dim glow pervades the air,
its source a glowing sphere set in the high domed ceiling of the chamber,
which is circular in shape and reminds you of an observatory more than an
office. Peering upwards, you realize that the roof is cunningly designed
to resemble the night sky, with the sphere representing the sun, as it would
look set in a starry field instead of through the atmosphere of the planet.

Hall of Communication~
Knowledge cannot be learned, or shared, without some form of verbal
or written communication, and thus the Seekers hold such forms of
transmitting of knowledge in high regard. This Hall leads to the
chambers where the Seekers communicate with each other, waxing verbose
on a wide variety of subjects, as the Seekers are wont to do. The
art here is what you would expect, depicting raconteurs, lecturers
and other speakers engaging in rhetoric.

Annals of Lore~
The Seekers are a highly communicative order, but the nature of their
quests for knowledge and magical power often means that they are
seperated from each other for extended periods of time. Thus they have
established a medium by which they can keep abreast of each other's doings,
in the form of the mystic tome, within which they can scribble anything that
they want their peers to know, and get a response when they return. It is
here that the leaders announce policy to the order, to ensure all read it,
and where important issues such as elections, quests and runs are announced.
Sometimes even the Gods themselves send short missives to their worshippers
in the order via this tome.

scrolls and other items of use to scholars who seek to travel in the
dangerous world outside the Haven. The floor here is stone, not marble,
and shows signs of heavy wear, as this is where most members of the Order
tend to converge in between expeditions.

The Forge of the Seekers~
A wave of heat hits you as you enter this chamber, its source a well-
stocked blacksmith's workshop to the east. The walls here are lined with
weapons and armor in various states of (dis)repair, either awaiting repair
or pick up by their owners. Adventuring members of the Order have their
needs met almost immediately, as the Order recognizes the urgency of such
needs, and the desire for members in need of equipment repair to quickly
return to their quests.

The Anvil of Ra'vern~
A brightly glowing adamantium anvil fills most of this sweltering
chamber, heated by the roaring blaze in the stone and metal forge, set
in the east wall. The heat is almost as unbearable as the noise; the
immensely strong smith smashes his hammer down with incredible force as
he hammers the dents from a battered breastplate, while he waits for
a newly forged blade to cool. He will be happy to repair your equipment,
but will not sell any of his own creations; these are made for special
members only.

Walking down the southern passage, you pass into a shop, positively
packed with all sorts of items that a Seeker would be likely to need,
and many which they wouldn't. Scrolls, flasks, beakers, pouches, ropes,
elixirs, vials and powders make up but a portion of what is available
in the warehouse-sized place. The counter where purchases are counted 
and charged for lies at the back of the shop, to the east.

Overconfident, and a trifle greedy, he is nevertheless still loyal to his
order, and will charge (reasonably) fair prices for his stock, which is
guaranteed to never be depleted.

they contain a wealth of information about the world and its many
types of inhabitants. Geography, history, politics and other subjects
are all covered; name the subject and you would doubtless find a text

labs, where Seekers may come to study, learn and experiment. More
books and tomes line the walls here, as well as portraits of famed
scholars and sages, not all of them Seekers; many were granted an
honorary membership during or after their lifetimes though. To the
west you can see the largest laboratory, where mages and clerics 
busy themselves preparing magical items.

Lab of the Seekers~
A large laboratory lies here, the size of a large stables or school
house. But the vast majority of the space is taken up by tables and
benches laden with all manner of devices, from alembics and beakers
to funnels and burners, each serving a vital role in the various
experiments undertaken here. It is so cramped that not more than 2 or
3 people could possibly work in here at the same time, for fear of
bumping into each other and ruining days of work.

Hall of Recreation~
Even scholars and magicians need sometimes to rest and partake of a meal,
and in this section of the sanctum provision is made for those needs.
Originally most of the members of the order would subsist on magical food
and drink when in need, but in these times the Seekers have realized it is
best to strike a balance between labor and rest, and have created a rather
elaborate series of chambers for rest and relaxation, as depicted on the
walls here, which bear images of Seekers sleeping, meditating and feasting.
Such a turnaround has resulted in the Seekers gaining a legendary reputation
for the culinary delights their chefs invoke.

Kitchen of the Magician~
This broad chamber is filled with a large single table, lined with
enough chairs to seat the entire order, and then some. Behind this table
lies what is generally regarded as the finest kitchen in all of Brythunia.
Pots, pans and kettles bubble over a stone of truly immense proportions,
magically woven steel invoked by the master chef, who is a Seeker of
considerable power and talent that has devoted his time to creating culinary
delights for the enjoyment of the order, free of charge. Open doorways
to the east and west lead into private lounges where offduty Seekers may
rest and relax, and share tobacco and tales.

The Lounge of Science~
This wing of the relaxation area contains several comfortable chairs,
a row of shelves crammed with scientific journals, and a map of the
Cosmos, the latest made by the Order's astronomers. A low table lies
between the chairs, used to keep the latest issues, but more often
used by those who relax here as a footrest.

The Lounge of the Clergy~
The long standing disagreements between scientific and religious
authorities is legendary, and due to unfortunate incidents in the past,
the Order has wisely voted to establish two seperate lounges, where
proponents of the two camps can rest and wax lyrical on their beliefs,
free from derisive comments by the other. Of course this rarely works
in practice; frequently a mage will "accidentally" wander into this
lounge and overhear something he finds ludicrous, and snaps back, which
initiates a flame war (mages, fireballs, clerics, flamestrikes, the
term should be obvious).

A Windy Trail~
This narrow trail winds around one of the taller hills in the range,
a small mountain almost, that soars above you. A stiff breeze chills
you, even through your thick clothing, and you draw your cloak more
tightly around yourself as you press onwards. It is rumored that the
Haven of the Seekers is located somewhere in the Westhills; perhaps
you might get a chance to see it?

A Steep Climb~
The trail ends here, at the base of a short cliff face, atop which you
think you can see another trail, though from this angle you cannot be
sure. The cliff is overgrown with thick grass, and large granite
protuberences at regular intervals would make this a possible, if 
exhausting climb. The wind howls eerily around the bend in the trail,
sending shivers up and down your spine.

Approaching the Summit~
Although short, the cliff is quite difficult to climb, as you find
after a few movements which cause large clumps of rock and dirt to
break away from the cliff face and plummet downwards. More than once
the lack of strong hand and footholds, combined with the whipping
wind, threatens to send you falling back to the rocky hillside path
below.

Another Path~
As you near the summit, your suspicions are confirmed- there is indeed
another path here, that you have reached, that continues on into the
peaks of the Westhills. But to your dismay you note that the path runs
very steeply upwards, and is almost too narrow to even attempt; goats
would shy away before beginning that ascent. But an incentive has been
added- in the distance you can see the shining spires of a castle or
fortress, protruding from atop the peak which the goat track circumvents.
The Haven of the Seekers, Bed of Knowledge, lies very near!
