umber hulk~
an umber hulk~
An umber hulk lumbers toward you!
~
This is a large, bulky creature with a thick purple hide. Multiple eyes
glare at you from above two huge jagged tusks that protrude from its drooling
maw. This grotesque has slain many adventurers- lets hope you're not next!

riding lizard~
a riding lizard~
A Drow riding lizard glares sullenly at you.
~
This reptile resembles a huge Komodo dragon, save that it has a leather saddle
upon its back, and an ornate bridle upon its huge scaly head. Its eyes are
sullen and mean, but also rather lifeless, as if domesticity has drained the
urge to kill from this beast.

drow merchant~
a Drow merchant~
A Drow merchant eyes you suspiciously.
~
Drow are dark-skinned elves, evil brethren of the fair surface-dwelling elves
that you are familiar with. And while most Drow attack any outsiders on sight,
this fellow holds back, for he is a merchant first and a drow second, and will
never alienate potential customers...

bugbear~
a bugbear guard~
A bugbear guards eyes you suspiciously as he hefts his weapon.
~
Bugbears are evil creatures, eight feet tall and covered with patchy grey
fur. Beady red eyes stare from a feline face topped with huge ears. They
are very aggressive, but not when controlled by their Drow masters, whom they
hate and fear.

trog troglodyte~
a troglodyte slave~
A troglodyte slave snarls menacingly.
~
The weakest creatures native to the underdark, these pathetic miscreants
resemble slimy reptillian elves, with large fins atop their heads. They
typically wield clubs and spears while serving as guards, but usually are
found bearing heavy parcels for their Drow masters.

A displacer beast~
A displacer beast shimmers into existence and attacks!
~
These creatures resemble giant panthers with four suckered tentacles 
protruding from their abdomens. They have the ability to distort the
perceptions of their victims, making them very hard to hit.

hook horror~
a hook horror~
Seconds after you hear the dreadful clicking, a hook horror attacks!
~
Hook horrors are giant scaly creatures with giant sets of pincers for hands,
which rend the flesh of their foes, causing horrific injuries. Hook horrors 
are infamous for the distinctive clicking they make with their claws, which 
warn an alert traveller of their imminent attack.

gnome svirfneblin~
a Svirfneblin~
A Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnome, cautiously approaches you.
~
These gnomes are distant cousins of the surface-dwelling variety of gnomes,
and share many characteristics. They are the only good-natured race native
to the underdark, but are by no means weak because of it. They share a close
friendship with earth elementals, and it wouldn't be wise to challenge a
deep gnome when one is nearby.

~
These scouts are intended for reconnaissance, not combat, and thus this Drow
is irritated at being discovered, for he is woefully unprepared to deal with
you.

you want to enter, nor does he really care. He's actually looking forward to
a good romp with his dryad slave girls, then some goblin hunting in the
mushroom forests after he finishes his shift.

Descent Into The Underdark~
You slowly advance into the solid darkness that lies before you, your light
source flickering feeble as it combats the inky blackness here. It almost has
a substance, and you feel like it is pressing at you from all sides, suffocating
you. Fighting off a wave of claustrophobic-induced nausea, you steel yourself
and march into the depths.

The Underdark~
What little light that emanated from your entrance point to the north has now
disappeared entirely, and you feel another wave of panic overcome you, as 
your mind rebels against this utterly alien environment. Even the Dwarven
mines weren't as bad as this- here there is no light, no sound, just utter
darkness, only slightly lessened by your light source. It is said that the
Underdark itself has a far greater impact on adventurers than its many
dangerous denizens.

A Cavern~
You suddenly emerge into a large cavern, and are relieved to see more light
as your light source reflects off hundreds of tiny crystals imbedded in the
walls and ceiling of this cave. Hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites
obscure your vision, but you are fairly sure you can see exits to the east
and south. You hear what sounds like construction going on to the east.

A Cavern~
You have entered yet another of the innumerable caverns that exist in the
underdark. This one has no crystals to enhance your light, however, and
you slowly creep around the circumference to locate any exits. You find
passages to the east and west, and steeply sloping passages to the north and
south, the northern one sloping upward, the souther downward.

You have stumbled across the lair of some horrid beast, evidenced by the
numerous skeletons that crunch beneath your boots as you advance. You are
not sure, but you think you can hear snorting up ahead, but your relief at
finally hearing SOMETHING is overcome by a feeling of dread regarding what is
making the noise.

A Small Cavern~
This cavern was the site of a small skirmish recently. Corpses of dark elves,
stripped of their equipment lie scattered about, though there are no corpses
of other races- evidently the victors took their dead with them.

Passages head north, east and south here.

luxuriant and fresh now appears decayed and stale. Torn shreds of cheap 
material hang from battered and splintered wardrobes while stained sheets
cover a wooden plank suspended between two barrels. The illusion which 
enticed you has been dispelled, and now you must deal with the very real

A Twisting Tunnel~
This tunnel twists and turns as it wends its sinuous way into the depths of
the Underdark. Strange moss and lichen glow dimly in small recesses in the
walls, though they provide insufficient light to navigate by.

You enter a large cavern, filled with the usual array of stalactites and
stalagmites, with two small caves to the east and west. A north-south
passage runs through the middle.

A Cave~
This small cave is obviously the lair of some denizen of the Underdark. As
you pick your way past decaying corpses, skeletons and pieces of broken
equipment, you silently pray that this particular denizen is not home right 
now.

This area of the Underdark looks heavily travelled. Large numbers of humanoids
of many races have travelled east up and down from here.

A Small Cave~
Several large crates and containers have been left here, along with dozens
of corpses- creatures who have had their brains sucked out by hungry 
Illithids.

Here reside the Wererat guards/bully boys who work for the Illithid slave
traders. You see some Illithid have a penchant for brains, and the Wererats
are excellent purveyors.

Outside the Pens~
You are standing in a large cave with a metal gate barring access to the
north. From behind this grate emanates an awful stench. You have no idea
what the purpose of this area is, and you aren't sure you care to find out...

The Ghoul Pens~
Here the Drow breed new ghouls for their armies, by creating one or two and
then throwing unarmed human slaves to them to be tortured and slain, and
resurrected as ghouls. It is an effective, low cost breeding system. Pity
you're in here- you're considered feed...

A Rest Stop~
This is a rest stop for travellers going to and from Menzoberranzan, fell
capital of the Drow holdings. It has been deserted for some time now,
perhaps due to the unsavory habits of its latest occupant...
