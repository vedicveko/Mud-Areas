*Banshide
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova


This zone was written using a smattering of information found on various
websites regarding the mysterious Banshee and their traditional home,
Banshide.  We implemented a new attack type for the mobs in this zone
called EMBRACE since a banshee's way of killing their victim is to embrace
them and drain their life.

The village itself is nestled in a deep hollow in the depths of the Sinister
Forest, available for download as well.  The way into the village is a
difficult maze, actually VERY difficult.  There are 4 ways in, as listed
below;

-entering west:  w2snes3w
-entering north: ns3esnwn
-entering east:  ewen4se
-entering south: s2esesn2s

I post these here only because after I made the zone and tried to enter as
my mortal without these directions, I could not find my way in and I am the
one who made the zone!  The reason for this pain in the ass way into the
village is because 1)there is some kick ass eq in there that shouldn't be 
easy to get and 2)there is the Fountain of Eternal Life that we made to
contain a neverending supply of healing water - water that cast cure light
with every drink.  By making the village so difficult to find, we felt it
would keep this fountain from being abused.
