WHAT IS THIS?

A Patch to implement the Doll Mage class.

INSTALLING

Copy dollmage.patch to your Circle src directory and run patch < dollmage.patch

This patch was built off of circle30bpl16 and should patch cleanly off of a
stock source. If not look at the .rej files and patch by hand.

+ means add.
- means remove.
! means change.

USAGE

Doll Mages are a strange breed which use magical dolls to perform magic through
and thus must have an ITEM_DOLL held in order to cast magic or perform skills.

The value0 and value1 slots on ITEM_DOLLs are used to calculate a damage bonus.
Basicly they are sent to the number() function. value0 should be the low number
and value1 should be the high number.

This patch comes with six basic skills for Doll Mages.
All Doll Mage skills cost a small amount of Dana.

dollhit : level 1 damage
dollbite : level 5 damage
dollmaul : level 10 damage
dollshield : level 15, block hits with your doll.
dollwield : level 15, gain an extra attack w/ your doll helping out.
dollstrike : level 20 damage, can only be used to engage.

It also comes with seven basic skills.

Opaque, level 6, turn objs invis.
Coy level 16, AGGR mobs have second thoughts about attacking.
Flood level 17, sets RM_FLOOD and causes all mobs and players in that room
without a boat to take some damage each tick.
Acid level 20 area effect spell.
Radiance, level 25 area effect spell that sets blind.
Acid Storm, level 28 sets RM_ACID, does damage like Flood.
Hold Person, level 29, sets AFF_HELD, half assidly implemented.

I didn't even bother to give these skills and spells proper damage, since
every mud out there has a different idea on that sort of thing.

Some other things have been added that I will leave up to you to find. :P

DISTRIBUTING/CHANGING
